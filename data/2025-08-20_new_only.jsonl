(2) Constrained by the training corpus and limited context window,\nProtTeX is typically trained on single-protein inputs, rendering it\nincompatible with in-context learning (ICL) and thus limiting its\ngeneralization capability. To address these issues, we propose ProtTeX-CC, a\nlightweight two-stage compression framework designed to enhance ProtTeX under\nfew-shot settings. We first design a joint embedding compression mechanism that\nfuses sequence and structure representations at the residue level, effectively\nreducing the protein input length by half without sacrificing performance. Then\nwe propose a self-compression module that aggregates each full demonstration\ninto the latent space of the last few linguistic tokens, reducing the average\ndemonstration length from 751 tokens to less than 16 tokens. Compared to the\noriginal ProtTeX, our self-compression approach achieves a compression ratio of\napproximately 93.68% in the total prompt length under the 16-shot setting.\nWithout modifying the backbone model, ProtTeX-CC introduces only a small number\nof additional parameters through PEFT-based tuning in the joint embedding\ncompression stage and a single trainable projection layer in the\nself-compression stage.

In this work, we formulate and\nanalyze a deterministic compartmental model that captures the transmission of\nHPAI between dairy cattle and wild birds, incorporating both direct and\nindirect (environmental) routes. The model combines an $SEIR$ framework for\ncattle with an $SIR$ structure for wild birds, coupled through an environmental\ncompartment.

With this challenge in mind, we propose leveraging spatio-temporal\ndata analytics and machine learning models to enhance the detection of these\nphenomena. In this paper, our approach is inspired by causal modeling and aims\nto identify the root cause variables of hydrogen bond formation and separation\nevents.

These causal models\nare built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us\nto infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal\ngraphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step\nto infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal\nmodels. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional\ndistributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation,\nthis framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular\ndynamic systems.
