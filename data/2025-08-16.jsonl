In this paper, we discuss the construction of population\ngraphs using said genomic data. We first examine the GENPOFAD distance\nmeasurement, developed by Joly et. al., and prove that this constitutes a\nmetric function. We develop an algorithm to construct graphs to visualize the\nrelationships between individuals in a population. We then provide a\nstatistical analysis of these simulated population graphs, and show that they\nare distinct from randomly generated graphs, and also show differences from\nsmall-world graphs."}

Synthetic cohort simulations (N = 200) were\nreconciled with empirical PK benchmarks using Latin hypercube parameter\nsampling. Cross-validation, hold-out testing, and causal inference methods\n(inverse probability of treatment weighting and targeted maximum likelihood\nestimation) quantified predicted effects on lung function (delta FEV1).\n  Results: With reconciled parameters (F_dep = 0.12; k_abs = 0.21 per hour;\nk_muc = 0.24 per hour), epithelial lining fluid drug levels reached a peak\nconcentration of 7.5 micromolar (95 percent CI: 6 to 10 micromolar), achieving\nIC50 coverage for approximately 10 hours per day and greater than 80 percent\nmodeled NEU1 inhibition. Predicted mucus viscosity reduction averaged 25 to 28\npercent. Causal inference estimated delta FEV1 improvement of +0.13 liters (95\npercent CI: 0.10 to 0.15 liters), with about 70 percent mediated via MCC.\n  Conclusions: Empirically anchored PK/PD and biophysical modeling support the\nfeasibility of inhaled NEU1 inhibition as a rheology-targeting strategy in CF,\nprojecting clinically realistic efficacy while maintaining pharmacological\nviability. This calibrated proof of concept warrants in vivo validation in CF\nmodels."}

Alternative can be provided\nby reanalyses, but these are often expensive to run. We propose to use an\nensemble of neural networks (NN) to learn from a coupled\nphysics-biogeochemistry model the relationship between the directly observable\nvariables and carbon pools. We demonstrate for North-West European Shelf (NWES)\nsea environment, that when the NN trained on a model free run simulation is\napplied to the NWES reanalysis, it is capable to reproduce the reanalysis\noutputs for carbon pools. Moreover, unlike the existing NWES reanalysis, the NN\nensemble is also capable to provide uncertainty information for the pools. We\nfocus on explainability of the results and demonstrate potential use of the NNs\nfor future climate what-if scenarios. We suggest that model-informed machine\nlearning presents a viable alternative to expensive reanalyses and could\ncomplement observational data, wherever they are missing and/or highly\nuncertain."}

Toward this end,\nseveral connectome-informed models of neuroimaging biomarkers have been\nproposed. However, these models typically do not scale well beyond a small\nnumber of biomarkers due to heterogeneity in individual disease trajectories\nand a large number of parameters. To address this, we introduce the\nConnectome-based Monotonic Inference of Neurodegenerative Dynamics (COMIND).\nThe model combines concepts from diffusion and logistic models with structural\nbrain connectivity. This guarantees monotonic disease trajectories while\nmaintaining a limited number of parameters to improve scalability. We evaluate\nour model on simulated data as well as on the Parkinson's Progressive Markers\nInitiative (PPMI) data. Our model generalizes to anatomical imaging\nrepresentations from a standard brain atlas without the need to reduce\nbiomarker number."}

Strategic interactions involving Bayesian inferential\nstrategies can enable us to better understand how evolving individual choices\nto be altruistic or selfish can affect collective outcomes in social dilemmas.\nBayesian strategies are distinguished, from their reactive opponents, in their\nability to modulate their actions in the light of new evidence. We investigate\nwhether such strategies can be resilient against reactive strategies when\nactions not only determine the immediate payoff but can affect future payoffs\nby changing the state of the environment. We use stochastic games to mimic the\nchange in environment in a manner that is conditioned on the players' actions.\nBy considering three distinct rules governing transitions between a\nresource-rich and a resource-poor states, we ascertain the conditions under\nwhich Bayesian tit-for-tat strategy can resist being invaded by reactive\nstrategies. We find that the Bayesian strategy is resilient against a large\nclass of reactive strategies and is more effective in fostering cooperation\nleading to sustenance of the resource-rich state. However, the extent of\nsuccess of the Bayesian strategies depends on the other strategies in the pool\nand the rule governing transition between the two different resource states."}

VS has the potential to reduce\nthe cost and time needed for manual selection and wet-laboratory experiments.\nImproving the cost-effectiveness of virtual screening is a significant\nchallenge, aiming to explore larger compound libraries while maintaining lower\nscreening costs. Here, we present HelixVS, a structure-based VS platform\nenhanced by deep learning models. HelixVS integrates a precise deep\nlearning-based pose-scoring model and a pose-screening module into a\nmulti-stage VS process, enabling more effective screening of active compounds.\nCompared to classic molecular docking tools like Vina, HelixVS demonstrated\nsignificantly improved screening performance across nearly a hundred targets,\nachieving an average 2.6-fold higher enrichment factor (EF) and more than 10\ntimes faster screening speed. We applied HelixVS in four drug development\npipelines, targeting both traditional competitive drug-binding pockets and\nnovel protein-protein interaction interfaces. Wet-lab validations across these\npipelines consistently identified active compounds, with over 10% of the\nmolecules tested in wet labs demonstrating activity at uM or even nM levels.\nThis demonstrates the ability of HelixVS to identify high-affinity ligands for\nvarious targets and pockets. Furthermore, we provide a publicly available and\nfree version of HelixVS with limited computing power to assist drug development\nscientists in accelerating their drug discovery processes."}
