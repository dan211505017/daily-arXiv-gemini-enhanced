While current methods have made progress in modeling spatiotemporal\npatterns, they face three key limitations: (1) lack of generalizable framework\napplicable to diverse disease progression prediction tasks; (2) frequent\noverlook of the ordinal nature inherent in disease staging; (3) susceptibility\nto representation collapse due to structural similarities between adjacent time\npoints, which can obscure subtle but discriminative progression biomarkers. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a Generalizable LOngitudinal Medical\nImage Analysis framework for disease Progression prediction (GLOMIA-Pro).\nGLOMIA-Pro consists of two core components: progression representation\nextraction and progression-aware fusion. The progression representation\nextraction module introduces a piecewise orthogonal attention mechanism and\nemploys a novel ordinal progression constraint to disentangle finegrained\ntemporal imaging variations relevant to disease progression. The\nprogression-aware fusion module incorporates a redesigned skip connection\narchitecture which integrates the learned progression representation with\ncurrent imaging representation, effectively mitigating representation collapse\nduring cross-temporal fusion. Validated on two distinct clinical applications:\nknee osteoarthritis severity prediction and esophageal cancer treatment\nresponse assessment, GLOMIA-Pro consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art\nlongitudinal analysis methods. Ablation studies further confirm the\ncontribution of individual components, demonstrating the robustness and\ngeneralizability of GLOMIA-Pro across diverse clinical scenarios."}

Natural language processing (NLP) models may\nautomate and enhance overdose surveillance, but prior applications have been\nlimited. A dataset of 35,433 death records from multiple U.S. jurisdictions in\n2020 was used for model training and internal testing. External validation was\nconducted using a novel separate dataset of 3,335 records from 2023-2024.\nMultiple NLP approaches were evaluated for classifying specific drug\ninvolvement from unstructured death certificate text. These included\ntraditional single- and multi-label classifiers, as well as fine-tuned\nencoder-only language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers (BERT) and BioClinicalBERT, and contemporary decoder-only large\nlanguage models such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3. Model performance was assessed\nusing macro-averaged F1 scores, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to\nquantify uncertainty. Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models achieved near-perfect\nperformance, with macro F1 scores >=0.998 on the internal test set. External\nvalidation confirmed robustness (macro F1=0.966), outperforming conventional\nmachine learning, general-domain BERT models, and various decoder-only large\nlanguage models. NLP models, particularly fine-tuned clinical variants like\nBioClinicalBERT, offer a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose\ndeath classification from free-text reports.

We present a hybrid\nframework combining a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) with compressive\nsensing (CS) to disentangle such overlapping events in one-dimensional sensor\ndata. The FCN, trained on bead-derived datasets, accurately estimates\ncoincident event counts and generalizes to immunomagnetically labeled CD4+ and\nCD14+ cells in whole blood without retraining. Using this count, the CS module\nreconstructs individual signal components with high fidelity, enabling precise\nrecovery of single-cell features, including velocity, amplitude, and\nhydrodynamic diameter. Benchmarking against conventional state-machine\nalgorithms shows superior performance - recovering up to 21% more events and\nimproving classification accuracy beyond 97%. Explinability via class\nactivation maps and parameterized Gaussian template fitting ensures\ntransparency and clinical interpretability. Demonstrated with magnetic flow\ncytometry (MFC), the framework is compatible with other waveform-generating\nmodalities, including impedance cytometry, nanopore, and resistive pulse\nsensing.

Rapid global transmission overwhelmed\nhealthcare systems, resulting in high infection rates, hospitalisations, and\nfatalities. To minimise the spread, governments implemented several\nnon-pharmaceutical interventions like lockdowns and travel restrictions. While\neffective in controlling transmission, these measures also posed significant\neconomic and societal challenges. Although the WHO declared COVID-19 no longer\na global health emergency in May 2023, its impact persists, shaping public\nhealth strategies. The vast amount of data collected during the pandemic offers\nvaluable insights into disease dynamics, transmission, and intervention\neffectiveness. Leveraging these insights can improve forecasting models,\nenhancing preparedness and response to future outbreaks while mitigating their\nsocial and economic impact. This paper presents a large-scale case study on\nCOVID-19 forecasting in Cyprus, utilising a two-year dataset that integrates\nepidemiological data, vaccination records, policy measures, and weather\nconditions.

One\nwell-studied example is the emergence of autocatalytic sets, which seem to be a\nprerequisite for the evolution of life. Using a simple model, we investigate\nhow varying bias toward cooperation versus antagonism shapes network dynamics,\nrevealing that higher-order organization emerges even amid pervasive\nantagonistic interactions. In general, we observe that a quantitative increase\nin the number of elements in a system leads to a qualitative transition.\n  We present a random threshold-directed network model that integrates\nnode-specific traits with dynamic edge formation and node removal, simulating\narbitrary levels of cooperation and competition. In our framework, intrinsic\nnode values determine directed links through various threshold rules. Our model\ngenerates a multi-digraph with signed edges (reflecting support/antagonism,\nlabeled ``help''/``harm''), which ultimately yields two parallel yet\ninterdependent threshold graphs. Incorporating temporal growth and node\nturnover in our approach allows exploration of the evolution, adaptation, and\npotential collapse of communities and reveals phase transitions in both\nconnectivity and resilience.\n  Our findings extend classical random threshold and Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi models,\noffering new insights into adaptive systems in biological and economic\ncontexts, with emphasis on the application to Collective Affordance Sets. This\nframework should also be useful for making predictions that will be tested by\nongoing experiments of microbial communities in soil."}
