This paper introduces UniOTalign, a novel framework that\nrecasts alignment from a fundamentally different perspective: global matching\nvia Optimal Transport (OT). Instead of finding a path, UniOTalign computes an\noptimal flow or transport plan between two proteins, which are represented as\ndistributions of residues in a high-dimensional feature space. We leverage\npre-trained Protein Language Models (PLMs) to generate rich, context-aware\nembeddings for each residue. The core of our method is the Fused Unbalanced\nGromov-Wasserstein (FUGW) distance, which finds a correspondence that\nsimultaneously minimizes feature dissimilarity and preserves the internal\ngeometric structure of the sequences. This approach naturally handles sequences\nof different lengths and is particularly powerful for aligning proteins with\nnonsequential similarities, such as domain shuffling or circular permutations,\nwhich are challenging for traditional DP methods. UniOTalign therefore offers a\nnew, mathematically principled, global matching paradigm for protein alignment,\nmoving beyond the limitations of path-finding algorithms."}

However,\nrobust and generalizable methods for noninvasively quantifying valvular strain\nfrom clinically acquired patient images remain limited. In this work, we\npresent a novel feature-tracking framework for quantifying leaflet strain in\natrioventricular valves using 3D echocardiographic images of pediatric and\nadult patients. Our method demonstrated superior accuracy in the assessment of\nanatomical deformation and strain of heart valves compared to other point-based\napproaches, as verified against a finite element benchmark. Further, our\napproach can robustly track inter-phase deformation of valves across highly\nvariable morphologies without parameter tuning. Our analysis revealed that a\nmedian and interquartile range of the 1st principal strain greater than 0.5 is\nassociated with leaflet billow (prolapse). Further investigation of the\nbiomechanical signatures of heart valve disease has the potential to enhance\nprognostic assessment and longitudinal evaluation of valvular disease."}

Building on this\nperspective, we introduce EvoIF, a lightweight model that integrates two\ncomplementary sources of evolutionary signal: (i) within-family profiles from\nretrieved homologs and (ii) cross-family structural-evolutionary constraints\ndistilled from inverse folding logits. EvoIF fuses sequence-structure\nrepresentations with these profiles via a compact transition block, yielding\ncalibrated probabilities for log-odds scoring. On ProteinGym (217 mutational\nassays; >2.5M mutants), EvoIF and its MSA-enabled variant achieve\nstate-of-the-art or competitive performance while using only 0.15% of the\ntraining data and fewer parameters than recent large models. Ablations confirm\nthat within-family and cross-family profiles are complementary, improving\nrobustness across function types, MSA depths, taxa, and mutation depths.

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have\nrecently been employed to identify CDGs by capturing patterns in biological\ninteraction networks. However, most GNN-based approaches rely on a single\nprotein-protein interaction (PPI) network, ignoring complementary information\nfrom other biological networks. Some studies integrate multiple networks by\naligning features with consistency constraints to learn unified gene\nrepresentations for CDG identification. However, such representation-level\nfusion often assumes congruent gene relationships across networks, which may\noverlook network heterogeneity and introduce conflicting information. To\naddress this, we propose Soft-Evidence Fusion Graph Neural Network (SEFGNN), a\nnovel framework for CDG identification across multiple networks at the decision\nlevel. Instead of enforcing feature-level consistency, SEFGNN treats each\nbiological network as an independent evidence source and performs\nuncertainty-aware fusion at the decision level using Dempster-Shafer Theory\n(DST). To alleviate the risk of overconfidence from DST, we further introduce a\nSoft Evidence Smoothing (SES) module that improves ranking stability while\npreserving discriminative performance. Experiments on three cancer datasets\nshow that SEFGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and\nexhibits strong potential in discovering novel CDGs."}

ARGs, and their succinct\nrepresentation, tree sequences, are increasingly central to modern population\ngenetics methods, yet building an intuition for ARGs remains challenging. This\nis particularly true when analyzing ancestry in a geographic context, as there\nis a critical lack of dedicated, interactive tools capable of visualizing ARGs\nas spatiotemporal objects. To address this gap, we introduce ARGscape, an\ninteractive platform for simulating, analyzing, and visualizing ARGs across\nspace and time. ARGscape provides a user-friendly graphical interface featuring\ndynamic 2- and 3-dimensional visualizations to explore ARGs through space and\ntime, as well as a novel \"spatial diff\" visualization for quantitative\ncomparison of geographic inference methods. ARGscape is an innovative, unified\nframework that seamlessly integrates leading command-line, Python, and R-based\ntools for ARG simulation, manipulation, and use in spatiotemporal inference\ninto both graphical and command-line interfaces. By integrating these various\nfunctionalities, ARGscape facilitates novel data exploration and hypothesis\ngeneration, while lowering the barrier to entry for spatiotemporal ARG analysis\nin both research and education use-cases. ARGscape is built with a Python\nFastAPI backend and a React/TypeScript frontend. It is freely available as a\nlive demo at https://www.argscape.com and as a Python package on PyPI (pip\ninstall argscape). The source code and documentation are available on GitHub at\nhttps://github.com/chris-a-talbot/argscape."}

This manuscript considers aging from the perspective of\nentropy, wherein things fall apart. We first examine biological information\nchange as a mutational distance, analogous to physical distance. In this model,\ninformational change over time is fitted to an advection-diffusion equation, a\nnormal distribution with a time component. The solution of the\nadvection-diffusion equation provides a means of measuring the entropy of\ndiverse biological systems. The binomial distribution is also sufficient to\ndemonstrate that entropy increases as mutations or epimutations accumulate. As\nmodeled, entropy scales with lifespans across the tree of life. This\nperspective provides potential mechanistic insights and testable hypotheses as\nto how evolution has attained enhanced longevity: entropy management. We find\nentropy is an inclusive rather than exclusive aging theory."}

Why was\nour collective response to COVID-19 so much stronger than our response to the\nclimate emergency, to date? We hypothesize that the answer has to do with the\nscale of the systems, and not just spatial and temporal scales but also the\n`altruistic scale' that measures whether an action must rely upon altruistic\nmotives for it to be adopted. We treat COVID-19 and climate change as common\npool resource problems that exemplify coupled human-environment systems. We\nintroduce a framework that captures regimes of containment, mitigation, and\nfailure to control. As parameters governing these three scales are varied, it\nis possible to shift from a COVID-like system to a climate-like system. The\nframework replicates both inaction in the case of climate change mitigation, as\nwell as the faster response that we exhibited to COVID-19. Our cross-system\ncomparison also suggests actionable ways that cooperation can be improved in\nlarge-scale common pool resources problems, like climate change. More broadly,\nwe argue that considering scale and incorporating human-natural system\nfeedbacks are not just interesting special cases within non-cooperative game\ntheory, but rather should be the starting point for the study of altruism and\nhuman cooperation."}

However, current coupled\nhuman-environment models have not yet incorporated all three factors in\npolarized populations. We developed a stylized coupled human-environment model\nto investigate how social susceptibility, personal prejudice, and personal\nexperience shape opinion formation and the environment in polarized\npopulations. Using analytical and numerical methods, we characterized the\nconditions under which polarization, consensus, opinion changes, and cyclic\ndynamics emerge depending on the costs of mitigation, environmental damage, and\nthe factors influencing opinion formation. Our model shows that prejudice is\nthe key driver of persistent polarization, with even slightly prejudiced\npopulations maintaining indefinite polarization independent of their level of\nobjectivity. We predict that polarization can be reduced by decreasing the role\nof prejudice or increasing the willingness to consider opposing opinions.\nFinally, our model shows that cost reduction methods are less effective at\nreducing environmental impact in prejudiced populations. Our model generates\nthresholds for when reducing costs or emissions is more useful depending on the\nfactors which influence the population's opinion formation. Overall, our model\nprovides a framework for investigating the importance of cognitive and social\nstructures in determining human-environment dynamics."}
