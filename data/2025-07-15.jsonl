In\ncomputer science, a balanced tree is one that enables efficient updating and\nretrieval of data, whereas in biology tree balance quantifies bias in\nevolutionary processes. The lack of a precise connection between these concepts\nhas stymied the development of universal indices and general results. We\nrecently introduced a new tree balance index, $J^1$, that, unlike prior indices\npopular among biologists, permits meaningful comparison of trees with arbitrary\ndegree distributions and node sizes. Here we explain how our new index\ngeneralizes a concept that underlies the definition of the weight-balanced\ntree, an important type of self-balancing binary search tree. Our index thus\nunifies the tree balance concepts of biology and computer science. We provide\nnew analytical results to support applications of this universal index. First,\nwe quantify the accuracy of approximations to the expected values of $J^1$\nunder two important null models: the Yule process and the uniform model.\nSecond, we investigate minimal values of our index. These results help\nestablish $J^1$ as a universal, cross-disciplinary index of tree balance that\ngeneralizes and supersedes prior approaches."}

The objective\nof this study is to characterize these patterns to better understand the\ngeneral principles of neurodynamics in these conditions.\n  Methods A comprehensive array of methods to study brain rhythms and\nfunctional brain networks are used in the study, from spectral power measures\nto Lyapunov exponent, phase synchronization, temporal synchrony patterns, and\nmeasures of the functional brain connectivity. Furthermore, machine learning\ntechniques for classification are used to augment the methodology.\n  Results Multiple measures (spectral, synchrony, functional network\norganization) indicate an array of differences between neurodynamics between AD\nand FTD, and control subjects across different frequency bands.\n  Conclusions These differences taken together in an integrative way suggest\nthat AD neural activity may be less coordinated and less connected across\nareas, and more random, while FTD shows more coordinated neural activity\n(except slow frontal activity).\n  Significance AD and FTD may represent opposite changes from normal brain\nfunction in terms of the spatiotemporal coordination of neural activity.\nDeviations from normal in both directions may lead to neurological deficits,\nwhich are specific to each of the disorders."}

In this work, we introduce category-based topological sequence\nanalysis (CTSA ) of genomes. CTSA models a sequence as a resolution category,\ncapturing its hierarchical structure through a categorical construction.\nSubstructure complexes are then derived from this categorical representation,\nand their persistent homology is computed to extract multi-scale topological\nfeatures. Our models depart from traditional alignment-free approaches by\nincorporating structured mathematical formalisms rooted in sequence topology.\nThe resulting topological signatures provide informative representations across\na variety of tasks, including the phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 variants\nand the prediction of protein-nucleic acid binding affinities. Comparative\nstudies were carried out against six state-of-the-art methods. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that CTSA achieves excellent and consistent performance in\nthese tasks, suggesting its general applicability and robustness. Beyond\nsequence analysis, the proposed framework opens new directions for the\nintegration of categorical and homological theories for biological sequence\nanalysis."}

However, applying such\nmodels typically requires prior knowledge of change-point locations on the\nphylogeny or faces scalability issues with large data sets. To address both\nlimitations, we integrate branch-specific substitution models with shrinkage\npriors to automatically identify change-points without prior knowledge, while\nsimultaneously estimating distinct substitution parameters for each branch. To\nenable tractable inference under this high-dimensional model, we develop an\nanalytical gradient algorithm for the branch-specific substitution parameters\nwhere the computation time is linear in the number of parameters. We apply this\ngradient algorithm to infer selection pressure dynamics in the evolution of the\nBRCA1 gene in primates and mutational dynamics in viral sequences from the\nrecent mpox epidemic.

In the first part of the paper, the competition of two strains\nwhich have the same basic fitness (same reproduction number) but different\ntiming in quiescence is analyzed. Thereto, the complexity of the model is\nreduced: By a time scale argument, we approximate the SQIS model by an SIS\nmodel under the assumption of rapid switching between I and Q. Furthermore,\nusing dimension reduction methods for the van Kampen expansion of the models,\nwe replace the multi-dimensional SDE by an effective one dimensional SDE on the\ncenter manifold of the models. Finally, the fixation probabilities of the\nstrains are derived.\n  In the second part of the paper, we use concepts from adaptive dynamics to\nanalyze the stochastic random walk on the trait space. We find that quiescence\nis favored by intrinsic stochastic effects. In the end, a more intuitive\nexplanation is added to the mathematical arguments.\n  The analysis suggests a new paradigm for the evolution of quiescence in\nparasites: In the present context, quiescence is not a bed-hedging strategy to\nescape detrimental conditions in a fluctuating environment, but a simple and\nefficient method to continuously control and slow down the time scale of\nlife-history traits. It turns out that evolution favors slowness, with the\nanalysis suggesting that this effect may be widespread in systems where species\ninteract only indirectly through competition for resources."}
