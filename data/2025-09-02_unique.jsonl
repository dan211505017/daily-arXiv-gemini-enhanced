Traditional antibody discovery pipelines require\n10-12 months, limiting their applicability for rapid outbreak response. This\nproject introduces ImmunoAI, a machine learning framework that accelerates\nantibody discovery by predicting high-affinity candidates using\ngradient-boosted models trained on thermodynamic, hydrodynamic, and 3D\ntopological interface descriptors. A dataset of 213 antibody-antigen complexes\nwas curated to extract geometric and physicochemical features, and a LightGBM\nregressor was trained to predict binding affinity with high precision. The\nmodel reduced the antibody candidate search space by 89%, and fine-tuning on\n117 SARS-CoV-2 binding pairs further reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from\n1.70 to 0.92. In the absence of an experimental structure for the hMPV A2.2\nvariant, AlphaFold2 was used to predict its 3D structure. The fine-tuned model\nidentified two optimal antibodies with predicted picomolar affinities targeting\nkey mutation sites (G42V and E96K), making them excellent candidates for\nexperimental testing. In summary, ImmunoAI shortens design cycles and enables\nfaster, structure-informed responses to viral outbreaks."}

Such computational tools represent key\nreaction networks driving perturbation or drug response and can guide drug\ndiscovery and personalized therapeutics. Yet, their development still relies on\nlaborious data integration by the human modeler, so that automated approaches\nare critically needed. The success of data-driven system discovery in Physics,\nrooted in clean datasets and well-defined governing laws, has fueled interest\nin applying similar techniques in Biology, which presents unique challenges.\nHere, we reviewed methodologies for automatically inferring digital twins from\nbiological time series, which mostly involve symbolic or sparse regression. We\nevaluate algorithms according to eight biological and methodological\nchallenges, associated to noisy/incomplete data, multiple conditions, prior\nknowledge integration, latent variables, high dimensionality, unobserved\nvariable derivatives, candidate library design, and uncertainty quantification.\nUpon these criteria, sparse regression generally outperformed symbolic\nregression, particularly when using Bayesian frameworks. We further highlight\nthe emerging role of deep learning and large language models, which enable\ninnovative prior knowledge integration, though the reliability and consistency\nof such approaches must be improved. While no single method addresses all\nchallenges, we argue that progress in learning digital twins will come from\nhybrid and modular frameworks combining chemical reaction network-based\nmechanistic grounding, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, and the generative\nand knowledge integration capacities of deep learning. To support their\ndevelopment, we further propose a benchmarking framework to evaluate methods\nacross all challenges."}

But how many reticulations are\nneeded to display multiple trees? For any set of $t$ trees on $n$ leaves, there\nis a trivial network with $(t - 1)n$ reticulations that displays them. To do\nbetter, we have to exploit common structure of the trees to embed non-trivial\nsubtrees of different trees into the same part of the network. In this paper,\nwe show that for $t \\in o(\\sqrt{\\lg n})$, there is a set of $t$ trees with\nvirtually no common structure that could be exploited. More precisely, we show\nfor any $t\\in o(\\sqrt{\\lg n})$, there are $t$ trees such that any network\ndisplaying them has $(t-1)n - o(n)$ reticulations. For $t \\in o(\\lg n)$, we\nobtain a slightly weaker bound.

However, copying an extended molecule requires highly processive\ncopying machinery and high fidelity that scales with the genome size to avoid\nthe error catastrophe. Here, we explore these fidelity requirements in an\nalternative architecture, the virtual circular genome, in which no one physical\nmolecule encodes the full genetic information. Instead, information is encoded\nand transmitted in a collective of overlapping and interacting segments. Using\na model experimental system of a complex mixture of DNA oligos that can partly\nanneal and extend off each other, we find that mutant oligomers are suppressed\nrelative to a model without collective encoding. Through simulations and\ntheory, we show that this suppression of mutants can be explained by\ncompetition for productive binding partners. As a consequence, information can\nbe propagated robustly in a virtual circular genome even if the mutation rate\nis above the error catastrophe for a physically intact genome."}

In\nthis study, we develop a biophysically informed phase-field model to\ninvestigate the collective migration of the border cell cluster in the\nDrosophila melanogaster egg chamber. Our model captures key aspects of the egg\nchamber architecture, including the oocyte, nurse cells, and surrounding\nepithelium, and incorporates both mechanical forces and biochemical cues that\nguide cell migration. We introduce the Tangential Interface Migration (TIM)\nforce which captures contact-mediated propulsion generated along interfaces\nbetween the border cell cluster and surrounding nurse cells. Our simulations\nreveal three key features of TIM-driven migration that distinguish it from\nprevious forms of chemotaxis: (1) the necessity of border cell-nurse cell\noverlap to initiate movement (i.e., border cells cannot move without a nurse\ncell substrate), (2) motion is tangential to border cell-nurse cell interfaces,\nand (3) persistent migration even in regions where the spatial slope of\nchemoattractant is decreasing. Additionally, we demonstrate that with or\nwithout geometry-mediated alterations in chemoattractant distribution such as\nat intercellular junctions we can vary induced migration pauses, independent of\nmechanical confinement. We capture an experimentally observed transition to\ndorsal migration at the oocyte with a sustained medio-lateral chemical cue of\nsmall amplitude. The results show how spatial constraints and interfacial\nforces shape collective cell movement and highlight the utility of phase-field\nmodels in capturing the interplay between tissue geometry, contact forces, and\nchemical signaling."}
