Aiming to enhance the sensing accuracy and to elucidate\nthe foundational limits of Transabdominal Fetal Oximetry (TFO) via diffuse\noptics, we introduce a theoretical derivation, and a comprehensive pipeline for\nfSpO$_2$ estimation from non-invasively sensed diffuse light intensity values,\nwhich are leveraged to analyze datasets obtained through both simulations and\nin-vivo experiments in gold standard large animal model of pregnancy. We\npropose the Exponential Pulsation Ratio (EPR) as a key feature, and develop\nmachine-learning models to fuse the information collected across multiple\ndetectors. Our proposed method demonstrates a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of\n4.81% and 6.85% with a Pearson's r correlation of 0.81 (p<0.001) and 0.71\n(p<0.001) for estimation of fSpO$_2$ in simulated dataset and in-vivo dataset,\nrespectively. Across both datasets, our method outperforms the existing\napproaches, enhancing the accuracy of the fSpO$_2$ estimation and demonstrates\nits viability as a supplemental technology for intrapartum fetal monitoring."}

It is\nclassification-independent, incorporates abundance information, and has a\ntunable sensitivity to rare/abundant types. Using rich COVID-19 sequence data\nas a paradigm, we develop methods for applying the VS to time-resolved sequence\ndata. We show how the VS allows for characterization of the overall diversity\nof circulating viruses and for discernment of emerging variants prior to formal\nidentification. Furthermore, applying the VS to phylogenetic trees provides a\nconvenient overview of within-clade diversity which can aid viral variant\ndetection."}

The model describes the interaction dynamics between tumour\ncells and oxygen, and takes into account anisotropic cell movement and oxygen\ndiffusion related to structural anisotropy of the brain's extracellular\nenvironment. In this model, phenotypic heterogeneity of tumour cells is\ncaptured by a continuous phenotype-structuring variable, the value of which\nevolves due to phenotypic changes. We first analyse a one-dimensional version\nof the model and formally show, through a Hopf-Cole transformation, that it\nadmits, in appropriate asymptotic regimes, phenotypically heterogeneous\ntravelling wave solutions, wherein the locally prevailing cell phenotype varies\nacross the wave due to the presence of oxygen gradients. This provides a\nmathematical formalisation for the emergence of intratumour phenotypic\nheterogeneity driven by differences in oxygen availability across the tumour.\nWe then report on the results of both 1D simulations, which corroborate the\nresults of formal asymptotic analyses, and 2D simulations, which also\ndemonstrate the impact of anisotropy in cell movement and oxygen diffusion on\ntumour growth and on the phenotypic composition of the tumour edge. These\nresults are complemented with additional results of 3D simulations, which are\ncarried out on the geometry of the brain by using a hybrid finite\ndifference-finite element method and integrating patient-specific magnetic\nresonance imaging data with diffusion tensor imaging data."}
