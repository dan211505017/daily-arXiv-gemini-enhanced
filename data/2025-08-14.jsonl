Public\ndatabases often provide only qualitative descriptions without pharmacokinetic\ncontext. We present an interactive web tool that integrates 191,541 descriptive\nDDI records from DrugBank with 3,779 AUC-based interactions from the PK-DDIP\ndataset, extracted from FDA-approved drug labeling (DailyMed) using natural\nlanguage processing and manual verification. Using multi-step name\nharmonization (exact, fuzzy, synonym expansion, manual curation), 1,803\ninteraction pairs were unified across 639 overlapping compounds. The platform\nis built with Streamlit and offers smart drug search, color-coded output, and\nreal-time response. It enables users to explore both descriptive and\npharmacokinetic data, supporting research and education in clinical\npharmacology and drug safety. This research prototype is not intended for\nclinical decision-making."}

However, existing methods\noften rely heavily on prior databases or known structural information, making\nit difficult to resolve unknown structures. In addition, complex structures\ntypically require the joint analysis of multiple spectroscopic modalities. This\nprocess heavily depends on expert domain knowledge and is often accompanied by\nhigh costs in terms of both time and instrumentation. To address these\nchallenges, we propose SpectraLLM, the first large language model designed to\nsupport multi-modal spectroscopic joint reasoning. SpectraLLM is capable of\nprocessing either single or multiple spectroscopic inputs and performing\nend-to-end structure elucidation. By integrating continuous and discrete\nspectroscopic modalities into a shared semantic space, SpectraLLM learns to\nuncover substructural patterns that are consistent and complementary across\nspectra, enabling precise molecular structure elucidation. We pretrain and\nfine-tune SpectraLLM in the domain of small molecules, and evaluate it on six\nstandardized, publicly available chemical datasets. The model achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing approaches\ntrained on single modalities. Notably, SpectraLLM demonstrates strong\nrobustness and generalization even for single-spectrum inference, while its\nmulti-modal reasoning capability further improves the accuracy of structural\nprediction."}

However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem,\nwhere node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature\nprojection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this\nissue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our\nexploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to\nhandle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at\npreserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects\nfine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and\ncross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical\nglobal-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network\n(HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical\nfeature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP)\nmodule is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns\nto dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers\nand a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing\nhigh-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these\nmulti-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which\nflexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation\nfeatures, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and\nqualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods."}

Most\nstudied in short-lived and small-bodied species, cycles frequently appear to be\ndriven by density-dependent feedbacks. However, compelling evidence of cycles\n-- often more qualitative than quantitative -- also exists in large mammals.\nAmong ungulates, both density-dependent vital rates and 'cohort effects'\n(lasting impacts of birth conditions on fecundity and survival) exist, but the\nimplications of such feedbacks for oscillatory population dynamics have not\nbeen explored. Here, we present a synthetic model of ungulate population\ndynamics, parameterized for barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus\ngroenlandicus) and motivated by extensive Indigenous knowledge suggesting\ndecades-long fluctuations in abundance. Caribou herds are theorized to be\nsubject to both cohort effects and density dependence, and we linked these\nendogenous factors with environmental stochasticity to understand cycling.\nUsing wavelet analysis, we characterized periodic phenomena and performed\nsensitivity analyses to clarify the drivers and characteristics of population\ncycles. We found that cohort effects, predominantly those impacting survival,\ncan produce long-period oscillatory behavior across a wide range of\nenvironments and demographic structures. Our modeling framework is\ngeneralizable to other long-lived, large-bodied species with complex\ndemography, and collectively, these efforts broaden the scope of inquiry into\nproximal drivers of population cycling."}

Here, we\nrevisit the role of voluntary participation by allowing non-participants to\nexert either positive or negative impacts on the public good. Using\nevolutionary analysis in a well-mixed finite population, we find that positive\nexternalities from non-participants lower the synergy threshold required for\naltruistic punishment to dominate. In contrast, negative externalities raise\nthis threshold, making altruistic punishment harder to sustain. Notably, when\nnon-participants have positive impacts, altruistic punishment thrives only if\nnon-participation is incentivized, whereas under negative impacts, it can\npersist even when non-participation is discouraged. Our findings reveal that\nefforts to promote altruistic punishment must account for the active role of\nnon-participants, whose influence can make or break collective outcomes."}

In ecology, stochastic state-space models in discrete time are most\noften used to describe the imperfectly observed dynamics of population sizes or\nanimal movement.

To investigate such theoretical identifiability, a\nsuitable exhaustive summary is required, defined as a vector of parameter\ncombinations which fully determines the model. Previous work on exhaustive\nsummaries has used expectations of the stochastic process, so that noise\nparameters are unaccounted for. In this paper, we build an exhaustive summary\nusing the spectral density of the observed process, which fully accounts for\nall mean and variance parameters. This diagnostic is applied to contrasted\necological models and we show that they are generally theoretically\nidentifiable, unless some model compartements are unobserved.
