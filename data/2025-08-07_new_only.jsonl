However, the rules governing evolution of\ncomplexity appear more nuanced. Evolution is deeply connected to learning,\nwhere complexity is much better understood, with established results on optimal\ncomplexity appropriate for a given learning task. In this work, we suggest a\nmathematical framework for studying the relationship between evolved organismal\ncomplexity and enviroenmntal complexity by leveraging a mathematical\nisomorphism between evolutionary dynamics and learning theory. Namely, between\nthe replicator equation and sequential Bayesian learning, with evolving types\ncorresponding to competing hypotheses and fitness in a given environment to\nlikelihood of observed evidence. In Bayesian learning, implicit regularization\nprevents overfitting and drives the inference of hypotheses whose complexity\nmatches the learning challenge. We show how these results naturally carry over\nto the evolutionary setting, where they are interpreted as organism complexity\nevolving to match the complexity of the environment, with too complex or too\nsimple organisms suffering from \\textit{overfitness} and \\textit{underfitness},\nrespectively. Other aspects, peculiar to evolution and not to learning, reveal\nadditional trends. One such trend is that frequently changing environments\ndecrease selected complexity, a result with potential implications to both\nevolution and learning. Together, our results suggest that the balance between\nover-adaptation to transient environmental features, and insufficient\nflexiblity in responding to environmental challenges, drives the emergence of\noptimal complexity, reflecting environmental structure. This framework offers\nnew ways of thinking about biological complexity, suggesting new potential\ncauses for it to increase or decrease in different environments."}

Formulated as a\nsystem of semilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), the model\nextends classical compartmental models by incorporating spatial diffusion to\naccount for population movement and spatial heterogeneity. The proposed NSFD\ndiscretization is designed to preserve the continuous model's essential\nqualitative features, such as positivity, boundedness, and stability, which are\noften compromised by standard finite difference methods. We rigorously analyze\nthe model's well-posedness, construct a structure-preserving NSFD scheme for\nthe PDE system, and study its convergence and local truncation error.

Through saddle-node bifurcation\nanalysis, we identify the critical thresholds in the intervention parameters\nnecessary for infection elimination.

Traditional methods\nlike capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps are well-established\nbut labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal (IR) and RGB\nimagery, drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting. Our surveys\nwere conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and\nNovember 2024 in three areas of a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape.\nFlight transects were based on predefined launch points using a 350 m grid and\nan algorithm that defined the direction of systematically randomized transects.\nThis setup allowed surveying large areas in one day using multiple drones,\nminimizing double counts. Flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing\nroe deer (Capreolus capreolus) while ensuring detection. Animals were manually\nannotated in the recorded imagery and extrapolated to densities per square\nkilometer. We applied three extrapolation methods with increasing complexity:\nnaive area-based extrapolation, bootstrapping, and zero-inflated negative\nbinomial modelling. For comparison, a Random Encounter Model (REM) estimate was\ncalculated using camera trap data from the flight period. The drone-based\nmethods yielded similar results, generally showing higher densities than REM,\nexcept in one area in October. We hypothesize that drone-based density reflects\ndaytime activity in open and forested areas, while REM estimates average\nactivity over longer periods within forested zones. Although both approaches\nestimate density, they offer different perspectives on wildlife presence. Our\nresults show that drones offer a promising, scalable method for wildlife\ndensity estimation."}

In this study, we propose a novel deep\nlearning framework that uses a class-conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE)\nto augment training data for pan-cancer gene expression classification. Using\n801 tumor RNA-Seq samples spanning 5 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas\n(TCGA), we first perform feature selection to reduce 20,531 gene expression\nfeatures to the 500 most variably expressed genes. A cVAE is then trained on\nthis data to learn a latent representation of gene expression conditioned on\ncancer type, enabling the generation of synthetic gene expression samples for\neach tumor class. We augment the training set with these cVAE-generated samples\n(doubling the dataset size) to mitigate overfitting and class imbalance. A\ntwo-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier is subsequently trained on the\naugmented dataset to predict tumor type. The augmented framework achieves high\nclassification accuracy (~98%) on a held-out test set, substantially\noutperforming a classifier trained on the original data alone. We present\ndetailed experimental results, including VAE training curves, classifier\nperformance metrics (ROC curves and confusion matrix), and architecture\ndiagrams to illustrate the approach. The results demonstrate that cVAE-based\nsynthetic augmentation can significantly improve pan-cancer prediction\nperformance, especially for underrepresented cancer classes."}
