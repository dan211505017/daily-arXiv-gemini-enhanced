These landscapes are shaped by multiple factors, including local\nbiochemical signals and the three-dimensional organisation of chromatin.\nHowever, their response to genomic stress, such as DNA double-strand breaks\n(DSBs), remains incompletely understood. Here, we use a stochastic model of\nhistone modification dynamics integrated with chromatin architecture to\ninvestigate how local depletion of sirtuins, histone deacetylases involved in\nDSB repair, destabilises epigenetic patterns. Our simulations recapitulate\nexperimental findings in which sirtuin relocalisation to DSB sites leads to the\nepigenetic erosion and suggest that the resulting landscape depends on enzyme\nlevels and chromatin geometry. Importantly, chromatin regions with large\ndomains of long-range contacts are more resilient to epigenetic\ndestabilisation. These findings suggest that chromatin folding can buffer\nagainst relocation of histone-modifying enzymes, highlighting a structural\nmechanism for preserving epigenetic integrity under stress."}
