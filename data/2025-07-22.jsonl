Notably, the method remains theoretically valid even\nnear irregular points, such as singularities and boundaries, where traditional\ntesting approaches often break down. In this paper, we evaluate its practical\nperformance on a collection of biologically motivated models from\nphylogenetics. While the method performs remarkably well across different\nsettings, we catalogue a number of issues that should be considered for\neffective application."}

The ability to detect the directionality of such\ntrends is crucial for understanding and managing the dynamics of natural\nsystems. Nevertheless, identifying the key observable quantities that capture\nsuch directional behaviour poses a major challenge. In this study, we propose\nthat translating ecological data into a network framework is a valuable\nstrategy to measure system stability and evolution. We examine the Tangled\nNature model as a test case, evaluating network entropy, species diversity, and\nthe clustering coefficient as metrics of network stability and directionality."}
