Previous studies have used networks to\ndescribe interactions and explore the evolution of cooperation, but with\nlimited transposability to social settings due to biologically relevant\nassumptions. Exogenous processes -- that affect the individual and are not\nderived from social interactions -- even if unbiased, have a role in supporting\ncooperation over defection, and this role has been largely overlooked in the\ncontext of network-based interactions. Here, we show that selection can favor\neither cooperation or defection depending on the frequency of exogenous, even\nif neutral, processes in any population structure. Our framework allows for\nderiving analytically the conditions for favoring a specific behavior in any\nnetwork structure strongly affected by non-social environments (frequent\nexogenous forcing, FEF), which contrasts with previous computationally\nprohibitive methods. Our results demonstrate that the requirements for favoring\ncooperation under FEF do not match those in the rare-mutation limit,\nestablishing that underlying neutral processes can be considered a mechanism\nfor cooperation. We reveal that, under FEF, populations are less cooperative,\nand network heterogeneity can provide an advantage only if targeting specific\nnetwork properties, clarifying seemingly contradictory experimental results and\nevolutionary predictions. While focused on cooperation, our assumptions\ngeneralize to any decision-making process involving a choice between\nalternative options. Our framework is particularly applicable to\nnon-homogeneous human populations, offering a new perspective on cooperation\nscience in the context of cultural evolution, where neutral and biased\nprocesses within structured interactions are abundant."}
