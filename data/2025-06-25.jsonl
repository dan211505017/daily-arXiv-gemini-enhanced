BrainSymphony's strong\nmultimodal architecture processes functional MRI data through parallel spatial\nand temporal transformer streams, which are then efficiently distilled into a\nunified representation by a Perceiver module. Concurrently, it models\nstructural connectivity from diffusion MRI using a novel signed graph\ntransformer to encode the brain's anatomical structure. These powerful,\nmodality-specific representations are then integrated via an adaptive fusion\ngate. Despite its compact design, our model consistently outperforms larger\nmodels on a diverse range of downstream benchmarks, including classification,\nprediction, and unsupervised network identification tasks. Furthermore, our\nmodel revealed novel insights into brain dynamics using attention maps on a\nunique external psilocybin neuroimaging dataset (pre- and post-administration).\nBrainSymphony establishes that architecturally-aware, multimodal models can\nsurpass their larger counterparts, paving the way for more accessible and\npowerful research in computational neuroscience."}

We present a novel framework drawn from statistical\nphysics -- Maximum Caliber -- for characterizing the temporal dynamics of\ncomplex ecological systems in spatially extended landscapes and inferring\nparameters from temporal data. As an extension of Maximum Entropy modeling,\nMaximum Caliber models the probability of possible trajectories of a stochastic\nsystem, rather than focusing on system states. We demonstrate the ability of\nthe Maximum Caliber framework to capture ecological processes ranging from\nnear- to far- from-equilibrium, using an array of species interaction motifs\nincluding random interactions, apparent competition, intraguild competition,\nand non-transitive competition, along with dispersal among multiple patches.\nFor spatio-temporal data of species occurrence in a metacommunity, the\nparameters of a Maximum Caliber model can be estimated through a simple\nlogistic regression to reveal migration rates between patches, magnitudes of\ninteractions between species, and effects of intrinsic local environmental\nsuitabilities. We test the accuracy of the method over a range of system sizes\nand time periods, and find that these parameters can be estimated without bias.\nWe introduce entropy production as a system-level measure of disequilibrium,\nand use ``pseudo-$R^2$'' to characterize the predictability of the system. We\nshow that our model can predict the dynamics of metacommunities much better\nthan steady state models, when the system is far from equilibrium. The capacity\nto estimate basic parameters of dynamical metacommunity models from\nspatio-temporal data represents an important breakthrough for the study of\nmetacommunities with application to practical problems in conservation and\nrestoration ecology."}

Such an understanding within evolutionary\ngame theory so far has been sought by appealing to bounded rationality. Here,\nwe present a perceptual rationality framework in the context of group\ncooperative interactions, where individuals make rational decisions based on\ntheir evolvable perception of the environment. We show that a simple public\ngoods game accounts for power law distributed perceptual diversity.\nIncorporating the evolution of social information use into the framework\nreveals that rational decision-making is a natural root of the evolution of\nconsistent personality differences and power-law distributed behavioral\ndiversity. The behavioral diversity, core to the perceptual rationality\napproach, can lead to ever-shifting polymorphism or cyclic dynamics, through\nwhich different rational personality types coexist and engage in mutualistic,\ncomplementary, or competitive and exploitative relationships. This polymorphism\ncan lead to non-monotonic evolution as external environmental conditions\nchange. The framework provides predictions consistent with some large-scale\neco-evolutionary patterns and illustrates how the evolution of social structure\ncan modify large-scale eco-evolutionary patterns. Furthermore, consistent with\nmost empirical evidence and in contrast to most theoretical predictions, our\nwork suggests diversity is often detrimental to public good provision,\nespecially in strong social dilemmas."}

We begin by consolidating essential criteria that effective\nmeasures of functional diversity should meet. We then evaluate fifteen widely\nused functional diversity metrics against these criteria and assess their\nperformance across six synthetic ecosystem scenarios where optimal behavior is\nknown. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that none of the widely used metrics\nfully satisfy all the established requirements, and all fail in at least one\necosystem scenario. In particular, we find that almost all metrics flagrantly\nviolate set monotonicity and distance monotonicity, requirements that adding a\nnovel species should increase diversity, and that the magnitude of that\nincrease should grow with trait dissimilarity. We also find that metrics fail\nto decline when rare, functionally extreme species are lost, and even increase\nwhen a perfectly redundant species is added. These critical flaws leave them\nblind to the very biodiversity loss that functional diversity measures are\nintended to detect. Our findings underscore the urgent need to develop a new\ngeneration of functional diversity metrics that more accurately reflect\necological realities."}
