Expansion occurs\nduring the vegetative phase from a single ascospore, driven by the need to\nexplore and occupy surrounding space limiting competitors, enhancing nutrient\nuptake, and promoting spore dispersal. Radial, rapid, and rectilinear growth\ncombined with frequent branching appears adaptive. However, passive growth\nwithout interactions or feedback may produce suboptimal networks, as neither\nlocal density nor potential connectivity is considered. Reorientations of the\napex near existing hyphae suggest apex hypha feedback. Yet, the diversity of\nbehaviours, spontaneous fluctuations, and limited apical trajectories studied\nleave open the question of active regulation. To investigate possible apex\nhypha interactions, we analyse a dataset of Podospora anserina thallus growth\nby reconstructing all apical trajectories postbranching and fitting them with a\nclassical Langevin model that incorporates potential interactions. Comparing\nisolated and nonisolated hyphae trajectories allows to identify a clear\nsignature of interaction composed of abrupt deceleration and reorientation.\nThis work opens the path towards a systematic exploration of hyphal\ninteractions."}

By jointly encoding cellular morphology and gene\nexpression, PAST learns unified cross-modal representations that capture both\nspatial and molecular heterogeneity at the cellular level.

Methods: We used cross-sectional data from the 2012-2013\nAustralian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey. Multiple linear\nregression was used to test the association between serum 25(OH)D concentration\nand K5, adjusting for age, sex, education, remoteness, socioeconomic status,\nseason of blood collection, smoking, and alcohol intake (n = 1,983). We also\nstratified the analysis by sex and by remoteness. Results: There was no\nstatistically significant association between serum 25(OH) concentration and K5\nin the total population, nor when stratified by sex. When stratified by\nremoteness, higher serum 25(OH)D concentration was statistically significantly\nassociated with lower K5 scores among those living remotely (adjusted \\b{eta}:\n-0.18; 95% CI: -0.35, -0.01). Conclusions: Serum 25(OH)D concentration was\ninversely associated with psychological distress only among those living\nremotely.

However, the challenge of collecting exhaustive biodiversity\nrecords across spatial scales has hindered a comprehensive understanding of\nthese dynamics. Here, we develop a deep learning approach that leverages\nsampling theory and small-scale ecological surveys to spatially resolve the\nscale-dependency of species richness. We demonstrate its performance by\npredicting the species richness of vascular plant communities across Europe,\nand evaluate the predictions against an independent dataset of plant community\ninventories. Our model improves species richness estimates by 32\\% and delivers\nspatially explicit patterns of species richness and turnover for sampling areas\nranging from square meters to hundreds of square kilometers. Explainable AI\ntechniques further disentangle how drivers of species richness operate across\nspatial scales.

Recent large\nlanguage model (LLM) approaches to retrosynthesis have shown promise but\neffectively harnessing LLM reasoning capabilities for effective multi-step\nplanning remains an open question. To address this challenge, we introduce\nDeepRetro, an open-source, iterative, hybrid LLM-based retrosynthetic\nframework. Our approach integrates the strengths of conventional\ntemplate-based/Monte Carlo tree search tools with the generative power of LLMs\nin a step-wise, feedback-driven loop. Initially, synthesis planning is\nattempted with a template-based engine. If this fails, the LLM subsequently\nproposes single-step retrosynthetic disconnections. Crucially, these\nsuggestions undergo rigorous validity, stability, and hallucination checks\nbefore the resulting precursors are recursively fed back into the pipeline for\nfurther evaluation. This iterative refinement allows for dynamic pathway\nexploration and correction. We demonstrate the potential of this pipeline\nthrough benchmark evaluations and case studies, showcasing its ability to\nidentify viable and potentially novel retrosynthetic routes. In particular, we\ndevelop an interactive graphical user interface that allows expert human\nchemists to provide human-in-the-loop feedback to the reasoning algorithm. This\napproach successfully generates novel pathways for complex natural product\ncompounds, demonstrating the potential for iterative LLM reasoning to advance\nstate-of-art in complex chemical syntheses."}

To address this limitation, we\npropose PLAME, a novel MSA design model that leverages evolutionary embeddings\nfrom pretrained protein language models.
