In this paper, we propose a flexible and modular machine\nlearning-based approach for predicting the efficacy of an untested\npharmaceutical for treating a disease. We train a machine learning model using\nsets of pharmaceutical-pathway weight impact scores and patient data, which can\ninclude patient characteristics and observed clinical outcomes. The resulting\nmodel then analyses weighted impact scores of an untested pharmaceutical across\nhuman biological molecule-protein pathways to generate a predicted efficacy\nvalue. We demonstrate how the method works on a real-world dataset with patient\ntreatments and outcomes, with two different weight impact score algorithms We\ninclude methods for evaluating the generalisation performance on unseen\ntreatments, and to characterise conditions under which the approach can be\nexpected to be most predictive. We discuss specific ways in which our approach\ncan be iterated on, making it an initial framework to support future work on\npredicting the effect of untested drugs, leveraging RWD clinical data and drug\nembeddings."}

Recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between gut\nmicrobiota and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that microbial composition may\nserve as a promising biomarker. Although deep learning models based ongut\nmicrobiota show potential for early prediction, most approaches rely on single\nclassifiers and often overlook inter-strain correlations or temporal dynamics.\nTherefore, there is an urgent need for more robust feature extraction methods\ntailored to microbiome data. Methods: We proposed BDPM (A Machine\nLearning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut\nMicrobiota Analysis). First, we collected gut microbiota profiles from 39\nParkinson's patients and their healthy spouses to identify differentially\nabundant taxa. Second, we developed an innovative feature selection framework\nnamed RFRE (Random Forest combined with Recursive Feature Elimination),\nintegrating ecological knowledge to enhance biological interpretability.\nFinally, we designed a hybrid classification model to capture temporal and\nspatial patterns in microbiome data."}

It defines string complexity by statistically modeling the k-mer\ncount distribution with the parameters: the k-mer length, the context window\nsize and a threshold on complexity.

However, despite its availability, a considerable\nproportion of the public has either refused or delayed getting vaccinated. This\nreluctance is known as vaccine hesitancy. The aim of this paper is to present a\nmathematical model to investigate how social interaction can impact vaccine\nhesitancy. The model describes the temporal transitions between different\nvaccination classes of the population (those vaccinated, those who are not yet\nvaccinated but agree to be vaccinated, and those who refuse). We apply the\nmodel to state and national survey data from the USA to estimate model\nparameters that quantify the rates at which public opinion on vaccination\nchanges. Moreover, we investigate how political trends and demographic factors,\nsuch as age and education, impact these parameters. Our results show that\nstate-level political affiliation, age, and educational level shape opinions on\nvaccination and have a strong influence on the temporal dynamics of attitude\nchanges."}

The method achieves\nlower error across all targets (MAE: R0 0.0616 vs 0.275; transmission 0.0715 vs\n0.128; contact 1.02 vs 4.24), produces tighter predictive intervals with near\nnominal coverage, and reduces wall clock time from 77.4 s to 2.35 s per\ncalibration.
