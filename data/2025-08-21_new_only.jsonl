Here, we introduce VIBES, a\nmulti-scale modeling framework that explicitly integrates viral dynamics based\non patient-level data with population-level transmission on a data-driven\nnetwork of social contacts. Using SARS-CoV-2 as a case study, we analyze three\nemergent epidemic properties, namely the generation time, serial interval, and\npre-symptomatic transmission. First, we established a purely biological\nbaseline, thus independent of the reproduction number (R), from the within-host\nmodel, estimating a generation time of 6.3 days for symptomatic individuals and\n43.1% presymptomatic transmission. Then, using the full model incorporating\nsocial contacts, we found a shorter generation time (5.4 days at R=3.0) and an\nincrease in pre-symptomatic transmission (52.8% at R=3.0), disentangling the\nimpact of social drivers from a purely biological baseline. We further show\nthat as pathogen transmissibility increases (R from 1.3 to 6), competition\namong infectious individuals shortens the generation time and serial interval\nby up to 21% and 13%, respectively. Conversely, a social intervention, like\nisolation, increases the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission by about\n30%. Our framework also estimates metrics that are challenging to obtain\nempirically, such as the generation time for asymptomatic individuals (5.6\ndays; 95%CI: 5.1-6.0 at R=1.3). Our findings establish multi-scale modeling as\na powerful tool for mechanistically quantifying how pathogen biology and human\nsocial behavior shape epidemic dynamics as well as for assessing public health\ninterventions."}

Peck", "David Waxman"], "title": "How can we measure the information created by natural selection?", "categories": ["q-bio.PE", "92D15"], "comment": null, "summary": "Natural selection can create information. In particular, because of the\naction of natural selection, we can often learn something about an environment\nby examining local organisms, and vice versa. For example, the characteristics\nof a cactus suggest that the local environment is relatively dry, and if a\nnatural terrestrial environment is dry, then we will generally have an enhanced\nprobability of finding drought-resistant plants (like cacti). Here, we propose\na measure that can be used to quantify the information that is created by\nnatural selection. We call the proposed quantity reproductive information, and\nwe show that it has an intuitively satisfying relationship to standard\nquantitative definitions of information. Reproductive information is also\napproximately equal to a previously defined measure of biological adaptation.\nIn addition, we explain how reproductive information can be measured using\nphenotypic characters, instead of genotypes. This could facilitate the\nmeasurement of reproductive information, and it could also allow for the\nquantification of the information that is created by natural selection on\ngroups of organisms, instead of just selection on individuals. Thus, the\nconcept of reproductive information has the potential to advance research on\nthe \"units of selection\", the \"major transitions in evolution\", and the\nemergence of \"superorganisms\" via cooperation among group members."}
