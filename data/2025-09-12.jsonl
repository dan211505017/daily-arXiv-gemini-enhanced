Understanding tumor-immune\ndynamics in rare melanomas is critical for the development of new therapies and\nfor improving response rates to current cancer therapies. Progress has been\nhindered by the lack of clinical data and the need for better preclinical\nmodels of rare melanomas. Canine melanoma provides a valuable comparative\noncology model for rare types of human melanomas. We analyzed RNA sequencing\ndata from canine melanoma patients and combined this with literature\ninformation to create a novel mechanistic mathematical model of melanoma-immune\ndynamics. Sensitivity analysis of the mathematical model indicated influential\npathways in the dynamics, providing support for potential new therapeutic\ntargets and future combinations of therapies. We share our learnings from this\nwork, to help enable the application of this proof-of-concept workflow to other\nrare disease settings with sparse available data."}

These insights are often obtained through complex Bayesian\nmodels, whose inference procedures are computationally intensive, especially\nwhen applied at scale to biological datasets. This limits the accessibility of\nadvanced modelling techniques needed to fully exploit proteomics data. Although\nSequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods offer a parallelisable alternative to\ntraditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo, their high-performance implementations\noften rely on specialised hardware, increasing both financial and energy costs.\nWe address these challenges by introducing an opportunistic computing framework\nfor SMC samplers, tailored to the demands of large-scale proteomics inference.\nOur approach leverages idle compute resources at the University of Liverpool\nvia HTCondor, enabling scalable Bayesian inference without dedicated\nhigh-performance computing infrastructure. Central to this framework is a novel\nCoordinator-Manager-Follower architecture that reduces synchronisation overhead\nand supports robust operation in heterogeneous, unreliable environments. We\nevaluate the framework on a realistic proteomics model and show that\nopportunistic SMC delivers accurate inference with weak scaling, increasing\nsamples generated under a fixed time budget as more resources join. To support\nadoption, we release CondorSMC, an open-source package for deploying SMC\nsamplers in opportunistic computing environments."}

This\nmechanism captures the insight that in part, people help others to build and\nmaintain a good reputation. To enable such cooperation, appropriate social\nnorms are essential. They specify how individuals should act based on each\nothers' reputations, and how reputations are updated in response to individual\nactions. Although previous work has identified several norms that sustain\ncooperation, a complete analytical characterization of all evolutionarily\nstable norms remains lacking, especially when assessments or actions are noisy.\nIn this study, we provide such a characterization for the public assessment\nregime. This characterization reproduces known results, such as the leading\neight norms, but it extends to more general cases, allowing for various types\nof errors and additional actions including costly punishment. We also identify\nnorms that impose a fixed payoff on any mutant strategy, analogous to the\nzero-determinant strategies in direct reciprocity. These results offer a\nrigorous foundation for understanding the evolution of cooperation through\nindirect reciprocity and the critical role of social norms."}

The transmission model considered Susceptible Exposed Infected\nRecovered Dead farm statuses to simulate within farm and between farm dynamics\nunder 3 day, 5 day, and 10 day detection delays. The single infected commercial\nfarm lost 15,650 birds, with 92% mortality due to HPAI, and additional culling\nof the remaining birds on Day 5 post-notification to the state animal health\nofficials. Based on the mortality and outbreak response data, the introduction\nlikely occurred 3 10 days before its official detection. Our field\ninvestigations suggested that wild birds were the most likely source of\nintroduction, although biosecurity breaches could not be ruled out. Control\nmeasures implemented included movement restrictions and a control zone, from\nwhich 4,197 vehicles were inspected upon entry.

This study is concerned with a recently\nproposed framework, which conceptualises development and ageing as a continuous\nprocess, driven by genetically encoded epigenetic changes in target sets of\ncells. According to the Evolvable Soma Theory of Ageing (ESTA), ageing reflects\nthe cumulative manifestation of epigenetic changes that are predominantly\nexpressed during the post-reproductive phase. These late-acting modifications\nare not yet evolutionarily optimised but are instead subject to ongoing\nselection, functioning as somatic \"experiments\" through which evolution\nexplores novel phenotypic variation. These experiments are often detrimental,\nleading to progressive physical decline and eventual death, while a small\nsubset may produce beneficial adaptations, that evolution can exploit to shape\nfuture developmental trajectories. According to ESTA, ageing can be understood\nas evolution in action, yet old age is also the strongest risk factor for major\ndiseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders,\nand metabolic syndrome. We argue that this association is not merely\ncorrelational but causal: the same epigenetic process that drive development\nand ageing also underlie age-associated diseases. Growing evidence points to\nepigenetic regulation as a central factor in these pathologies, since no\nconsistent patterns of genetic mutations have been identified, whereas\nwidespread regulatory and epigenetic disruptions are observed. From this\nperspective, evolution is not only the driver of ageing but also the ultimate\nsource of the diseases that accompany it, making it the root cause of most\nage-related pathologies."}

In this model,\nindividuals' competition over a shared resource guides the population towards a\ncritical steady state with prolonged individual life time. Here we uncover that\nthe spatially extended model is characterized by hyperuniform density\nfluctuations. A hydrodynamic theory is derived by explicit coarse-graining,\nwhich shows good agreement with numerical simulations. Unlike previous models\nfor non-equilibrium hyperuniform states, our model does not exhibit\nconservation laws, even when approaching criticality. Instead, we trace the\nemergence of hyperuniformity to the divergence of timescales close to\ncriticality. These findings can have applications in engineering, cellular\npopulation dynamics and ecology."}
