However, the complexity of\nimplementing artificial intelligence (AI) solutions in pathology workflows has\nlimited widespread adoption. Here we present ORCA (Optimized Research and\nClinical Analytics), a comprehensive no-code AI platform specifically designed\nfor digital pathology applications. ORCA addresses critical barriers to AI\nadoption by providing an intuitive interface that enables pathologists and\nresearchers to train, deploy, and validate custom AI models without programming\nexpertise. The platform integrates advanced deep learning architectures with\nclinical workflow management, supporting applications from tissue\nclassification and cell segmentation to spatial distribution scoring and novel\nbiomarker discovery. We demonstrate ORCA's capabilities through validation\nstudies across multiple cancer types, showing significant improvements in\nanalytical speed, reproducibility, and clinical correlation compared to\ntraditional manual assessment methods. Our results indicate that ORCA\nsuccessfully democratizes access to state-of-the-art AI tools in pathology,\npotentially accelerating biomarker discovery and enhancing precision medicine\ninitiatives."}

One emerging\nfield, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet\nlab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient,\neffective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway\nanalysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus\nrecommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel\ncombination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First,\nmutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database.\nThen, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by\nmutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\nthat predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN\npredictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple\ndrug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible\ntreatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating\nCharacteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater\nthan 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing\nplayed an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating\nthat each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key\ndriver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted\ngene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer.\nOverall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective\nend-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible\ntreatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work."}

It continues to be one of the biggest\nglobal health problems, and its etiology has given rise to a huge array of\ntreatment outside of conventional chemotherapy. Melanoma is one of the\ndeadliest forms of skin cancer originating from melanocytes. It is\ncharacterized by the overproduction of melanin by the increased in cell\nproliferation. Melanogenesis, the production of melanin is by\nmelanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) which stimulates cyclic AMP (cAMP)\nproduction to increase melanocyte production. Through the use of\nmethylxanthines, theophylline proliferation rate can be decreased by increasing\ncell differentiation. One of the basic principles of cell biology is the\nselectivity of differentiation and proliferation, where cells usually grow or\ndifferentiate but not both. This study aimed to collect baseline data of\nuntreated B16-F10 melanoma cells to determine morphology and doubling time of\nuntreated cells. This data was further compared to results from varied\nconcentration treatments of theophylline. It was hypothesized that increased\nlevels in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) could induce differentiation of\nmelanocytes to terminate proliferation. To test this hypothesis, we collected a\nseries of images of B16- F10 derived from mouse melanoma cells and seeded cells\ninto a 12-well plate to calculate cell concentration for a five-day period and\ndoubling time for untreated cells. Theophylline levels were varied to stimulate\nthe production of cAMP and determine its effect on melanocyte proliferation and\ndifferentiation. The observed results showed that intracellular stabilization\nof cAMP, via phosphodiesterase inhibition by methylxanthines like theophylline,\nincreases cell differentiation on melanoma cells and suppresses their growth."}

We represent\ndynamic systems as spatiotemporal multiplex graphs and model their latent\ntrajectories using a GNN-parameterized vector field. Given the sparse context\nobservations at node and edge levels, the model infers a distribution over\nlatent initial states and control variables, enabling both interpolation and\nextrapolation of trajectories. We validate the method on three synthetic\ndynamical systems (coupled pendulum, Lorenz attractor, and Kuramoto\noscillators) and two real-world cardiac imaging datasets - ACDC (N=150) and UK\nBiobank (N=526) - demonstrating accurate reconstruction, extrapolation, and\ndisease classification capabilities.

Existing studies in MPC design for epidemic control often\nassume either 1) measurable states of the dynamics, where the parameters are\nlearned, or 2) known parameters of the model, where the states are learned. In\nthis work, we address the joint real-time estimation of states and parameters\nwithin the MPC framework using only noisy infected states, under the assumption\nthat 1) only the recovery rate is known, or 2) only the basic reproduction\nnumber is known. Under the first assumption, we propose MPC-PINNs and two novel\nPINNs algorithms, all of which are integrated into the MPC framework. First, we\nintroduce MPC-PINNs, which are designed for $SIR$ models with control. We then\npropose log-scaled PINNs (MPC-LS-PINNs), which incorporate a log-scaled loss\nfunction to improve robustness against noise. Next, we present split-integral\nPINNs (MPC-SI-PINNs), which leverage integral operators and state coupling in\nthe neural network training process to effectively reconstruct the complete\nepidemic state information. Building upon these methods, we further extend our\nframework for the second assumption. We establish the necessary conditions and\nextend our PINNs algorithms, where MPC-SI-PINNs are simplified as split-PINNs\n(MPC-S-PINNs). By incorporating these algorithms into the MPC framework, we\nsimultaneously estimate the epidemic states and parameters while generating\noptimal control strategies.

Introducing a\nlight-emitting dumbbell as a minimal model, we study the Lagrangian dynamics of\nflashing in a homogeneous isotropic turbulent flow, and contrast it with that\nin an extensional flow and a Gaussian random flow. We show that turbulent\nfluctuations strongly enhance bioluminescence, while introducing a Poisson-like\nstochasticity in the flashing dynamics. Furthermore, the intermittent\nfluctuations of the velocity-gradient subjects the dinoflagellate to bursts of\nextreme straining and produces bright flashes -- more intense, though less\nfrequent, than what would result from Gaussian fluctuations.
