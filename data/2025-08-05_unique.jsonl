Using Monte-Carlo Arithmetic (MCA)\nsimulations, we assessed the most commonly used linear registration tools\nwithin major software packages (SPM, FSL, and ANTs) across multiple image\nsimilarity measures, two brain templates, and both healthy control (HC, n=50)\nand Parkinson's Disease (PD, n=50) cohorts. Our findings highlight the\ninfluence of linear registration tools and similarity measures on numerical\nstability. Among the evaluated tools and with default similarity measures, SPM\nexhibited the highest stability. FSL and ANTs showed greater and similar ranges\nof variability, with ANTs demonstrating particular sensitivity to numerical\nperturbations that occasionally led to registration failure. Furthermore, no\nsignificant differences were observed between healthy and PD cohorts,\nsuggesting that numerical stability analyses obtained with healthy subjects may\ngeneralise to clinical populations. Finally, we also demonstrated how numerical\nuncertainty measures may support automated quality control (QC) of linear\nregistration results. Overall, our experimental results characterize the\nnumerical stability of linear registration experimentally and can serve as a\nbasis for future uncertainty analyses."}

In most reported studies,\nvirtually stained images have been assessed only using traditional image\nquality measures such as structural similarity or signal-to-noise ratio.\nHowever, in biomedical imaging, images are typically acquired to facilitate an\nimage-based inference, which we refer to as a downstream biological or clinical\ntask. This study systematically investigates the utility of virtual staining\nfor facilitating clinically relevant downstream tasks (like segmentation or\nclassification) with consideration of the capacity of the deep neural networks\nemployed to perform the tasks. Comprehensive empirical evaluations were\nconducted using biological datasets, assessing task performance by use of\nlabel-free, virtually stained, and ground truth fluorescence images. The\nresults demonstrated that the utility of virtual staining is largely dependent\non the ability of the segmentation or classification task network to extract\nmeaningful task-relevant information, which is related to the concept of\nnetwork capacity. Examples are provided in which virtual staining does not\nimprove, or even degrades, segmentation or classification performance when the\ncapacity of the associated task network is sufficiently large. The results\ndemonstrate that task network capacity should be considered when deciding\nwhether to perform virtual staining."}

The prevalence of this heterogeneity can be explained as a\nbet-hedging strategy that improves the population proliferation rate (fitness)\nin fluctuating environments. The phenotype distribution is influenced by\nfactors such as competition between phenotypes, the duration of environmental\nstates, and the rate of phenotype-switching. We illustrate these effects in a\nsystem where both the environment and the phenotype can adopt two states. This\nsystem includes scenarios such as symmetric bet-hedging and\ndormant-proliferating phenotypes. We examine how environmental and phenotypic\nstates share mutual information, measured in bits, and explore the relationship\nbetween this information and population fitness. We propose that when fitness\nis measured relative to the case where phenotype and environment are\nindependent, information and fitness can be treated as equivalent measures. We\ninvestigate strategies that individuals can use to improve this information,\nsuch as adjusting the rates of proliferation and phenotype-switching relative\nto the environmental fluctuation rate. Through these strategies, with fixed\nmarginal distributions, an increase in information implies an increase in\npopulation fitness. We also identify limits to the maximum achievable fitness\nand information and discuss the value of the information in terms of this new\nnormalized fitness. Our framework offers new insights into how organisms adapt\nto fluctuating environmental conditions."}

Here, we study microbial evolution in partially predictable\nenvironments using proteome allocation models that capture the trade-off\nbetween growth rate and lag time during environmental transitions. We\ndemonstrate that evolution drives populations toward an evolutionary stable\nallocation strategy that minimizes resource depletion time, thereby balancing\nfaster growth with shorter adaptation delays. In environments with temporal\nstructure, populations evolve to learn the statistical patterns of\nenvironmental transitions through proteome pre-allocation, with the evolved\nallocations reflecting the transition probabilities between conditions. Our\nframework reveals how microbial populations can extract and exploit\nenvironmental predictability without explicit neural computation, using the\nproteome as a distributed memory system that encodes environmental patterns.\nThis work demonstrates how information-theoretic principles govern cellular\nresource allocation and provides a mechanistic foundation for understanding\nlearning-like behavior in evolving biological systems."}
