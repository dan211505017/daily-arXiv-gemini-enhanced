However, their effectiveness is limited when\nrelying solely on molecular sequences, which fail to capture the complex\nstructures of molecules. Beyond sequence representation, molecules exhibit two\ncomplementary structural views: the first focuses on the topological\nrelationships between atoms, as exemplified by the graph view; and the second\nemphasizes the spatial configuration of molecules, as represented by the image\nview. The two types of views provide unique insights into molecular structures.\nTo leverage these views collaboratively, we propose the CROss-view Prefixes\n(CROP) to enhance LLMs' molecular understanding through efficient multi-view\nintegration. CROP possesses two advantages: (i) efficiency: by jointly\nresampling multiple structural views into fixed-length prefixes, it avoids\nexcessive consumption of the LLM's limited context length and allows easy\nexpansion to more views; (ii) effectiveness: by utilizing the LLM's\nself-encoded molecular sequences to guide the resampling process, it boosts the\nquality of the generated prefixes. Specifically, our framework features a\ncarefully designed SMILES Guided Resampler for view resampling, and a\nStructural Embedding Gate for converting the resulting embeddings into LLM's\nprefixes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CROP in tasks\nincluding molecule captioning, IUPAC name prediction and molecule property\nprediction."}

The challenge that encoding addresses is the need for\nmechanisms that uniquely retain contextual information about the succession of\nindividual symbols, which can then be modeled by nonlinear formulations such as\nneural networks.\n  Context: Universal Sequence Maps(USM) are iterated functions that bijectively\nencode symbolic sequences onto embedded numerical spaces. USM is composed of\ntwo Chaos Game Representations (CGR), iterated forwardly and backwardly, that\ncan be projected into the frequency domain (FCGR). The corresponding USM\ncoordinates can be used to compute a Chebyshev distance metric as well as k-mer\nfrequencies, without having to recompute the embedded numeric coordinates, and,\nparadoxically, allowing for non-integers values of k.\n  Results: This report advances the bijective fractal encoding by Universal\nSequence Maps (USM) by resolving seeding biases affecting the iterated process.\nThe resolution had two results, the first expected, the second an intriguing\noutcome: 1) full reconciliation of numeric positioning with sequence identity;\nand 2) uncovering the nature of USM as an efficient numeric process converging\ntowards a steady state sequence embedding solution. We illustrate these results\nfor genomic sequences because of the convenience of a planar representation\ndefined by an alphabet with only 4 tokens (the 4 nucleotides). Nevertheless,\nthe application to alphabet of arbitrary cardinality was found to be\nstraightforward."}

However, species can also emerge in continuous homogeneous environments\nthrough isolation by distance. When the environment is not homogeneous, natural\nselection contributes to differentiation by local adaptation and tends to\nfacilitate speciation. To explore how isolation by distance and adaptation\ncombine to determine species diversity, we implemented a model regulated by\nthese two components. The first is implemented via mating restrictions on\nspatial proximity and genetic similarity. The second is realized by an\necological phenotype subjected to adaption and natural selection. We consider\nscenarios where the environment is either homogeneous, with a single ecological\noptimum, or heterogeneous with two distinct optima. In homogeneous environments\nno speciation is observed under permissive mating restrictions, independent on\nthe strength of natural selection. On the other hand, if reproduction requires\nclose genetic similarity (strict mating restrictions), speciation occurs only\nunder strong selection. In contrast, in environments with two local optima and\nstrong selection, species well adapted to each of the niches emerge along the\nspatial structure, leading to the formation of groups with distinct phenotypes.\nPermissive mating restrictions leads to the formation of only two species, each\noccupying one of the niches; strong mating restriction leads to several species\nper niche, in a much faster speciation process. Interestingly, when selection\nis weak and reproduction requires strong genetic similarity, several species\nform, but the process is slow. Moreover, species average phenotypes do not\nremain constant over generations, causing the phenotypic distribution to\noscillate, never reaching a stationary pattern."}

These\nfindings often assume that threats are homogeneously distributed in the\nlandscape. In some cases, threats are more concentrated near the edge of\nprotected areas. As protected areas expand, core habitat in the centre expands\nmore rapidly than its edge, potentially creating a refuge from threats. In this\npaper, we present a framework linking protected area expansion and threat\nmanagement to extinction risk, via their impact on population carrying capacity\nand growth rate within core and edge habitats. We demonstrate the framework\nusing a simple population model where individuals are uniformly distributed in\na circular protected area threatened by poachers who penetrate the protected\narea to a fixed distance. We parameterise the model for Peter's Duiker\n(Cephalophus callipygus) harvested for food in the dense undergrowth of African\nforests using snares. Expanding protected areas can reduce extinction risk more\neffectively compared to an equivalent investment in snare removal for larger\nprotected areas that already sustain core unhunted habitat. Our results\ndemonstrate the importance of protected area expansion in buffering susceptible\npopulations from fixed hunting pressure restricted to protected area edges.\nHowever, for cases where threats, wildlife, and managers respond to each other\nstrategically in space, the relative importance of expansion versus increased\nmanagement remains a significant open problem."}

This\nframework enables the explicit modeling of incubation periods and\ndisease-induced mortality. We derive key actuarial quantities, including the\npresent value of annuity benefits, payment streams, and net premiums, based on\nSEIARD dynamics. We formulate a prospective reserve function and analyze its\nevolution throughout the course of an epidemic. Additionally, we examine the\nforces of infection, mortality, and removal to assess their impact on\nepidemic-adjusted survival probabilities. Numerical simulations implemented via\na nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) scheme illustrate the model's\napplicability under various parameter settings and insurance policy\nassumptions."}
