Following pre-processing\nof molecular graphs, enforcement of class-balance and stratification of all\ndatasets across 5 folds, Bayesian optimisations were carried out, for each GNN\napplied to each assay dataset (resulting in 21 unique Bayesian optimisations).\nOptimised GNNs performed at Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores ranging from\n0.728-0.849 (averaged across all folds), naturally varying between specific\nassays and GNNs. GINs were found to consistently outperform GCNs and GATs, for\nthe top 5 of 7 most data-abundant toxicological assays. GATs however\nsignificantly outperformed over the remaining 2 most data-scarce assays. This\nindicates that GINs are a more optimal architecture for data-abundant\nenvironments, whereas GATs are a more optimal architecture for data-scarce\nenvironments.

The lack of large, annotated datasets for model\ntraining exacerbates this issue, limiting the development of automated tools\nthat could assist radiologists. To address this, we introduce CM-UNet, which\nleverages self-supervised pre-training on unannotated datasets and transfer\nlearning on limited annotated data, enabling accurate disease detection while\nminimizing the need for extensive manual annotations. Fine-tuning CM-UNet with\nonly 18 annotated images instead of 500 resulted in a 15.2% decrease in Dice\nscore, compared to a 46.5% drop in baseline models without pre-training. This\ndemonstrates that self-supervised learning can enhance segmentation performance\nand reduce dependence on large datasets. This is one of the first studies to\nhighlight the importance of self-supervised learning in improving coronary\nartery segmentation from X-ray angiography, with potential implications for\nadvancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice.

Arrhenotoky is a form of asexual reproduction in which\nunfertilized eggs become males while fertilized eggs develop into females,\nleading to unusual patterns of genetic relatedness between family members. This\nmode of reproduction occurs in insects such as the Hymenoptera, including bees.\nIn the hive environment, bees often display altruistic behavior, or actions\ntaken by an organism that reduce its own fitness to increase the fitness of\nothers. Eusociality, an elaborate form of social organization characterized by\ncomplex and altruistic social behaviors, is also observed in the Hymenoptera.\nTo explore the interplay between altruism and the reproductive patterns of\narrhenotoky, we employ a population dynamics model to simulate beehive\npopulations over a range of parameters, controlling for altruism in workers and\nthe queen. Our results show that altruistic behaviors are essential for beehive\nsuccess, with optimal worker altruism corresponding to the division of labor\nobserved in eusocial species. Furthermore, we find that modest altruism from\nthe queen is also vital for hive survival, emphasizing the delicate balance\nthat can exist in these complex social systems. Overall, our findings shed\nlight on the co-evolution of altruism, arrhenotoky, and eusociality in the\nnatural world."}

We present the first\nsystematic investigation of pathology FM robustness to non-biological features.\nOur work (i) introduces measures to quantify FM robustness, (ii) demonstrates\nthe consequences of limited robustness, and (iii) proposes a framework for FM\nrobustification to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we developed PathoROB,\na robustness benchmark with three novel metrics, including the robustness\nindex, and four datasets covering 28 biological classes from 34 medical\ncenters. Our experiments reveal robustness deficits across all 20 evaluated\nFMs, and substantial robustness differences between them. We found that\nnon-robust FM representations can cause major diagnostic downstream errors and\nclinical blunders that prevent safe clinical adoption. Using more robust FMs\nand post-hoc robustification considerably reduced (but did not yet eliminate)\nthe risk of such errors.
