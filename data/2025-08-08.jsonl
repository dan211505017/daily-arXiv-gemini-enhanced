Many deep\nlearning technologies are being employed to quickly and automatically classify\nimages. However, most of the time, the resolution of these microscopic pictures\nis quite low, which might make it difficult to classify them correctly. Some\npicture improvement techniques, such as image super-resolution, are being\nutilized to improve the resolution of the photos to get around this issue. The\nsuggested study uses large image dimension upscaling to investigate how\npicture-enhancing approaches affect classification performance. The study\nspecifically looks at how deep learning models may be able to understand more\ncomplex visual information by capturing subtler morphological changes when\nimage resolution is increased using cutting-edge techniques. The model may\nlearn from standard and augmented data since the improved images are\nincorporated into the training process. This dual method seeks to comprehend\nthe impact of image resolution on model performance and enhance classification\naccuracy. A well-known model for picture categorization is used to conduct\nextensive testing and thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.\nThis research intends to create more efficient image identification algorithms\ncustomized to a particular dataset of white blood cells by understanding the\ntrade-offs between ordinary and enhanced images."}

Existing ambient sampling approaches suffer from low data\nretention rates, environmental interference, and limited temporal resolution.\nWe developed SCOUT (Smart Cannula-mounted Optical Unit for Trace-methane), the\nfirst robust in-vivo sensing system enabling continuous, high-resolution\nmonitoring of ruminal methane concentrations through an innovative closed-loop\ngas recirculation design. We conducted comprehensive validation with two\ncannulated Simmental heifers under contrasting dietary treatments, with\ncross-platform comparison against established ambient sniffer systems. SCOUT\nachieved exceptional performance with 82% data retention compared to 17% for\nconventional sniffer systems, while capturing methane concentrations 100-1000x\nhigher than ambient approaches. Cross-platform validation demonstrated strong\nscale-dependent correlations, with optimal correlation strength (r = -0.564\n$\\pm$ 0.007) at biologically relevant 40-minute windows and 100% statistical\nsignificance. High-frequency monitoring revealed novel behavior-emission\ncoupling, including rapid concentration changes (14.5 $\\pm$ 11.3k ppm)\ntriggered by postural transitions within 15 minutes, insights previously\ninaccessible through existing technologies. The SCOUT system represents a\ntransformative advancement, enabling accurate, continuous emission phenotyping\nessential for genomic selection programs and sustainable precision livestock\nmanagement. This validation framework establishes new benchmarks for\nagricultural sensor performance while generating unprecedented biological\ninsights into ruminal methane dynamics, contributing essential tools for\nsustainable livestock production in climate-conscious agricultural systems."}

Continual learning is supposed to help train\nmodels without catastrophic forgetting. However, state-of-the-art methods are\nineffective for multiple instance learning (MIL), which is often used in\nsingle-cell-based hematologic disease diagnosis (e.g., leukemia detection).\nHere, we propose the first continual learning method tailored specifically to\nMIL. Our method is rehearsal-based over a selection of single instances from\nvarious bags. We use a combination of the instance attention score and distance\nfrom the bag mean and class mean vectors to carefully select which samples and\ninstances to store in exemplary sets from previous tasks, preserving the\ndiversity of the data. Using the real-world input of one month of data from a\nleukemia laboratory, we study the effectiveness of our approach in a class\nincremental scenario, comparing it to well-known continual learning methods.

This\nprinciple has been interpreted as underpinning modern understandings of\nheredity and evolution, implying the unidirectionality of information flow from\nnucleic acids to proteins. Here, we propose a generalisation of the Central\nDogma as a division of labour between the transmission and expression of\ninformation: the transmitter (nucleic acids) perpetuates information across\ngenerations, whereas the expressor (protein) enacts this information to\nfacilitate the transmitter's function without itself perpetuating information.\nWe argue that this generalisation offers two benefits. First, it provides a\nunifying perspective for comparing the Central Dogma to analogous divisions of\nlabour observed at vastly different biological scales, including multicellular\norganisms, eukaryotic cells, organelles, and bacteria. Second, it offers a\ntheoretical framework to explain the Central Dogma as an outcome of evolution.\nSpecifically, we review a mathematical model suggesting that the Central Dogma\noriginates through spontaneous symmetry breaking driven by evolutionary\nconflicts between different levels of selection. By reframing the Central Dogma\nas an informational relationship between components of a system, this\ngeneralisation underscores its broader relevance across the biological\nhierarchy and sheds light on its evolutionary origin."}

The imputation model was\nbased on an internal validation substudy and indicators recorded in the\nregistry (e.g., pathology reports, imaging claims), prognostic variables (e.g.,\nstage at diagnosis), and characteristics associated with missing data (e.g.,\ninsurance coverage). We pooled hazard ratios (HR) and 95% Confidence Intervals\n(CI) across 1000 imputed datasets, adjusted for age, stage, grade, subtype,\nrace and ethnicity, marital status, and urban/rural county at diagnosis. There\nwere 1,606 patients with a validated outcome (75% with breast cancer\nrecurrence) and we imputed the outcome for the remaining 23,439 patients.
