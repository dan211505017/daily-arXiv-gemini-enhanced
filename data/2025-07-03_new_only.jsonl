Here, we attempt to obtain molecular geometries by relying solely on\nmachine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) models. To this end, we first\ncurate a large-scale molecular relaxation dataset comprising 3.5 million\nmolecules and 300 million snapshots. Then MLIP foundation models are trained\nwith supervised learning to predict energy and forces given 3D molecular\nstructures. Once trained, we show that the foundation models can be used in\ndifferent ways to obtain geometries either explicitly or implicitly. First, it\ncan be used to obtain low-energy 3D geometries via geometry optimization,\nproviding relaxed 3D geometries for downstream molecular property predictions.\nTo mitigate potential biases and enhance downstream predictions, we introduce\ngeometry fine-tuning based on the relaxed 3D geometries. Second, the foundation\nmodels can be directly fine-tuned for property prediction when ground truth 3D\ngeometries are available. Our results demonstrate that MLIP foundation models\ntrained on relaxation data can provide valuable molecular geometries that\nbenefit property predictions."}

While diffusion models have proven highly\neffective in modeling complex, high-dimensional data distributions, real-world\napplications often demand more than high-fidelity generation, requiring\noptimization with respect to potentially non-differentiable reward functions\nsuch as physics-based simulation or rewards based on scientific knowledge.\nAlthough RL methods have been explored to fine-tune diffusion models for such\nobjectives, they often suffer from instability, low sample efficiency, and mode\ncollapse due to their on-policy nature. In this work, we propose an iterative\ndistillation-based fine-tuning framework that enables diffusion models to\noptimize for arbitrary reward functions. Our method casts the problem as policy\ndistillation: it collects off-policy data during the roll-in phase, simulates\nreward-based soft-optimal policies during roll-out, and updates the model by\nminimizing the KL divergence between the simulated soft-optimal policy and the\ncurrent model policy. Our off-policy formulation, combined with KL divergence\nminimization, enhances training stability and sample efficiency compared to\nexisting RL-based methods. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and\nsuperior reward optimization of our approach across diverse tasks in protein,\nsmall molecule, and regulatory DNA design."}

One of the core challenges of shape quantification is to\nensure that the extracted measurements remain invariant to transformations that\npreserve an object's intrinsic geometry, such as changing its size,\norientation, and position in the image. In this work, we introduce ShapeEmbed,\na self-supervised representation learning framework designed to encode the\ncontour of objects in 2D images, represented as a Euclidean distance matrix,\ninto a shape descriptor that is invariant to translation, scaling, rotation,\nreflection, and point indexing. Our approach overcomes the limitations of\ntraditional shape descriptors while improving upon existing state-of-the-art\nautoencoder-based approaches. We demonstrate that the descriptors learned by\nour framework outperform their competitors in shape classification tasks on\nnatural and biological images. We envision our approach to be of particular\nrelevance to biological imaging applications."}

Most previous work has focused\non the evolution of cooperation among boundedly rational individuals whose\ndecisions are governed by behavioral rules that do not need to be rational.\nHere, using an evolutionary model, we study how altruism can evolve in a\ncommunity of rational agents and promote cooperation. We show that in both\nwell-mixed and structured populations, a population of objectively rational\nagents is readily invaded by mutant individuals who make rational decisions but\nevolve a distorted (i.e., subjective) perception of their payoffs. This\npromotes behavioral diversity and gives rise to the evolution of rational,\nother-regarding agents who naturally solve all the known strategic problems of\ntwo-person, two-strategy games by perceiving their games as pure coordination\ngames."}

However, both approaches require datasets that are\nsubstantially larger than the manually collected cognate data currently\navailable. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no feasible approach to\nautomatically generate larger cognate datasets. We substantiate this claim by\nautomatically extracting datasets from BabelNet, a large multilingual\nencyclopedic dictionary. We demonstrate that phylogenetic inferences on the\nrespective character matrices yield trees that are largely inconsistent with\nthe established gold standard ground truth trees. We also discuss why we\nconsider it as being unlikely to be able to extract more suitable character\nmatrices from other multilingual resources. Phylogenetic data analysis\napproaches that require larger datasets can therefore not be applied to cognate\ndata. Thus, it remains an open question how, and if these computational\napproaches can be applied in historical linguistics."}
