However, in literature there seems to be no consensus\non the optimal eye alignment for such experiments. Typically, experiments are\nperformed by presenting stimuli nasally or temporally, but the angle under\nwhich the few-photon pulses are presented varies between 7 deg and 23 deg. Here\nwe combine a $3$-dimensional eye model with retinal rod density measurements\nfrom literature in a ray tracing simulation to study the optimal eye alignment\nconditions and necessary alignment precision. We find that stimuli, directed at\nthe eye's nodal point, may be best presented under an inferior angle of 13.1\ndeg with respect to the visual axis. Defining a target area on the retina with\na radius of 0.5 mm around the optimum location, we find the horizontal and\nvertical angular precision should be better than 0.85 deg given a horizontal\nand vertical translational precision of 1 mm and a depth translational\nprecision of 5 mm."}

Two\npredation strategies-center attack and nearest attack-are examined to assess\ntheir effects on prey survival, predator efficiency, and group dynamics.\nSimulations reveal diverse emergent behaviors such as prey dispersal and\nregrouping, oscillatory predation with collective defense, and predator\nencirclement. Results show that collective hunting enhances capture efficiency\ncompared to solitary attacks, but benefits diminish beyond a critical predator\ngroup size due to intra-predator competition.

Phylogenetic trees capture evolutionary relationships among isolates\nand provide a natural framework for detecting such adaptive signals. We present\na phylogeny-guided graph attention network (GAT) approach, introducing a method\nfor converting SNP-annotated phylogenetic trees into graph structures suitable\nfor neural network analysis. Using 500 M. tuberculosis isolates from four major\nlineages and 249 single-nucleotide variants (84 resistance-associated and 165\nneutral) across 61 drug-resistance genes, we constructed graphs where nodes\nrepresented isolates and edges reflected phylogenetic distances. Edges between\nisolates separated by more than seven internal nodes were pruned to emphasise\nlocal evolutionary structure. Node features encoded SNP presence or absence,\nand the GAT architecture included two attention layers, a residual connection,\nglobal attention pooling, and a multilayer perceptron classifier. The model\nachieved an accuracy of 0.88 on a held-out test set and, when applied to 146\nWHO-classified \"uncertain\" variants, identified 41 candidates with convergent\nemergence across multiple lineages, consistent with adaptive evolution. This\nwork demonstrates the feasibility of transforming phylogenies into\nGNN-compatible structures and highlights attention-based models as effective\ntools for detecting positive selection, aiding genomic surveillance and variant\nprioritisation."}

Levin", "Ted Loch-Temzelides"], "title": "Symbiosis emergence and abandonment in nature: a coordination game approach", "categories": ["q-bio.PE"], "comment": null, "summary": "We employ an n-player coordination game to model mutualism emergence and\nabandonment. We illustrate our findings in the context of the host--host\ninteractions among plants in plant-mycorrhizal fungi (MF) mutualisms. The\ncoordination game payoff structure captures the insight that mutualistic\nstrategies lead to robust advantages only after such \"biological markets\" reach\na certain scale. The game gives rise to three types of Nash equilibria, which\ncorrespond to the states derived in studies of the ancestral reconstruction of\nthe mycorrhizal symbiosis in seed plants. We show that all types of Nash\nequilibria correspond to steady states of a dynamical system describing the\nunderlying evolutionary process. We then employ methods from large deviation\ntheory on discrete-time Markov processes to study stochastic evolutionary\ndynamics. We provide a sharp analytical characterization of the stochastic\nsteady states and of the transition dynamics across Nash equilibria and employ\nsimulations to illustrate these results in special cases. We find that the\nmutualism is abandoned and re-established several times through evolutionary\ntime, but the mutualism may persist the majority of time. Changes that reduce\nthe benefit-to-cost ratio associated with the symbiosis increase the likelihood\nof its abandonment. While the mutualism establishment and abandonment could\nresult from direct transitions across the mutualistic and non-mutualistic\nstates, it is far more likely for such transitions to occur indirectly through\nintermediate partially mutualistic states. The MF-plant mutualism might be\n(partially or fully) abandoned by plants even if it provides overall superior\nfitness."}
