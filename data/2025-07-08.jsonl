Histomicrographic images of cell networks are often analyzed\nmanually, a process that is time-consuming and subjective. Automated tools like\nImageJ (NIH) can assist, but are often slow and inaccurate. Additionally, as\nendothelial networks grow more complex, traditional architectural metrics may\nnot fully reflect network maturity. To address these limitations, we developed\ntubuleTracker, a software tool that quantifies endothelial network architecture\nand maturity rapidly and objectively. Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial\ncells were cultured in an extracellular matrix, and 54 images were acquired\nusing phase contrast microscopy. Each image was analyzed manually by three\nindependent reviewers, and by both ImageJ and tubuleTracker. Key metrics\nincluded tubule count, total length, node count, tubule area, and vessel\ncircularity. In parallel, trained scientists rated each image for angiogenesis\nmaturity on a 1-5 scale (1 = most mature). Results: Analysis time per image\ndiffered significantly: manual (8 min), ImageJ (58+/-4 s), and tubuleTracker\n(6+/-2 s) (p<0.0001). Significant differences were also found in tubule count\n(manual 168+/-SD, tubuleTracker 92+/-SD, ImageJ 433+/-SD), length, and node\ncount (all p<0.0001). tubuleTracker's metrics varied significantly across\nangiogenesis maturity scores, including tubule count, length, node count, area,\nand circularity (all p<0.0001). Conclusions: tubuleTracker was faster and more\nconsistent than both manual and ImageJ-based analysis. Vessel circularity\nproved especially effective in capturing angiogenesis maturity. tubuleTracker\nis available as free shareware for the biomedical research community."}

However, capturing these\nprocesses requires extended simulation timescales that often exceed the\npractical limits of conventional models. To address this, shorter simulations,\ninitialized with diverse perturbations, are commonly used to sample phase space\nand explore a wide range of behaviors. Recent advances have leveraged language\nmodels to infer long-term behavior from short trajectories, but methods such as\nlong short-term memory (LSTM) networks are constrained to low-dimensional\nreaction coordinates, limiting their applicability to complex systems. In this\nwork, we present nano-GPT, a novel deep learning model inspired by the GPT\narchitecture, specifically designed to capture long-term dynamics in molecular\nsystems with fine-grained conformational states and complex transitions. The\nmodel employs a two-pass training mechanism that incrementally replaces\nmolecular dynamics (MD) tokens with model-generated predictions, effectively\nmitigating accumulation errors inherent in the training window. We validate\nnano-GPT on three distinct systems: a four-state model potential, the alanine\ndipeptide, a well-studied simple molecule, and the Fip35 WW domain, a complex\nbiomolecular system. Our results show that nano-GPT effectively captures\nlong-timescale dynamics by learning high-order dependencies through attention\nmechanism, offering a novel perspective for interpreting biomolecular\nprocesses."}

The basic\nreproduction number is used in disease modeling to predict the potential of an\noutbreak and the transmissibility of a disease, as well as by governments to\ninform public health interventions and resource allocation for controlling the\nspread of diseases.

Accurate\nkinetic modeling requires precise input function estimation, traditionally\nachieved via arterial blood sampling. However, arterial cannulation in small\nanimals like mice, involves intricate, time-consuming, and terminal procedures,\nprecluding longitudinal studies. This work proposes a non-invasive, fully\nconvolutional deep learning-based approach (FC-DLIF) to predict input functions\ndirectly from PET imaging, potentially eliminating the need for blood sampling\nin dynamic small-animal PET. The proposed FC-DLIF model includes a spatial\nfeature extractor acting on the volumetric time frames of the PET sequence,\nextracting spatial features. These are subsequently further processed in a\ntemporal feature extractor that predicts the arterial input function. The\nproposed approach is trained and evaluated using images and arterial blood\ncurves from [$^{18}$F]FDG data using cross validation. Further, the model\napplicability is evaluated on imaging data and arterial blood curves collected\nusing two additional radiotracers ([$^{18}$F]FDOPA, and [$^{68}$Ga]PSMA). The\nmodel was further evaluated on data truncated and shifted in time, to simulate\nshorter, and shifted, PET scans. The proposed FC-DLIF model reliably predicts\nthe arterial input function with respect to mean squared error and correlation.\nFurthermore, the FC-DLIF model is able to predict the arterial input function\neven from truncated and shifted samples. The model fails to predict the AIF\nfrom samples collected using different radiotracers, as these are not\nrepresented in the training data. Our deep learning-based input function offers\na non-invasive and reliable alternative to arterial blood sampling, proving\nrobust and flexible to temporal shifts and different scan durations."}

Our analysis involved a reduction of the\nfeature set from an original pool of 38,977 features, demonstrating a strong\nlinear relationship between genetic features and drug responses across various\nalgorithms, including SVR, Linear Regression, and Ridge Regression. Notably,\ncopy number variations (CNVs) emerged as more predictive than mutations,\nsuggesting a significant reevaluation of biomarkers for drug response\nprediction.

These dynamics can\nbe modeled by impulsive or flow-kick systems, where continuous flows alternate\nwith instantaneous discrete changes. To study species persistence in these\nsystems, an invasion growth rate theory is developed for flow-kick models with\nstate-dependent timing of kicks and auxiliary variables. The invasion growth\nrates are Lyapunov exponents characterizing the average per-capita growth of\nspecies when rare. Two theorems are proven to characterize permanence i.e. the\nextinction set is a repellor. The first theorem uses Morse decompositions of\nthe extinction set and requires that there exists a species with a positive\ninvasion growth rate for every invariant measure supported on a component of\nthe Morse decomposition. The second theorem uses invasion growth rates to\ndefine invasion graphs whose vertices correspond to communities and directed\nedges to potential invasions. Provided the invasion graph is acyclic,\npermanence is fully characterized by the signs of the invasion growth rates.\nInvasion growth rates are also used to identify the existence of\nextinction-bound trajectories and attractors that lie on the extinction set.\nThe results are illustrated with three applications: (i) a microbial serial\ntransfer model, (ii) a spatially structured consumer-resource model, and (iii)\nan empirically parameterized Lotka-Volterra model.

This ubiquity obscures an\nunderlying question: why do societies designate certain individuals exclusively\nfor the instruction of others? This question is especially enigmatic for\ndedicated teachers, who invest their labor in cultivating others' skills but do\nnot directly participate in the productive activities for which their students\nare being trained. To address this puzzle, we develop a simple, mathematically\ntractable model of teaching and learning in a population with a shared goal. We\nidentify a tradeoff between the size of the workforce and its collective level\nof expertise; and we analyze the optimal proportion of a population that should\nserve as teachers across a wide range of scenarios. We show that a population\nmust exceed a critical size before it is beneficial to allocate anyone as a\ndedicated teacher at all. Subsequently, the peak demand for teachers is\nachieved at an intermediate population size, and it never surpasses one half of\nthe population. For more complicated tasks, our analysis predicts the optimal\nallocation of teachers across different levels of expertise. The structure of\nthis teacher allocation is more complex when the population size is large, in\nagreement with the general size-complexity hypothesis. Our account lays a\nfoundation for understanding the adaptive advantage of dedicated teachers in\nboth human and non-human societies."}
