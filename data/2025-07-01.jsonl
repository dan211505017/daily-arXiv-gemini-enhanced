Traditional\nmodels struggle with the complexity of genomic and clinical data, but quantum\ncomputing offers enhanced computational capabilities. This study develops a\nhybrid quantum-classical transformer model, incorporating quantum attention\nmechanisms via variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to improve prediction\naccuracy. Using 30,000 anonymized cancer samples from the Genome Warehouse\n(GWH), data preprocessing included cleaning, encoding, and feature selection.\nClassical self-attention modules were replaced with quantum attention layers,\nwith classical data encoded into quantum states via amplitude encoding. The\nmodel, trained using hybrid backpropagation and quantum gradient calculations,\noutperformed the classical transformer model, achieving 92.8% accuracy and an\nAUC of 0.96 compared to 87.5% accuracy and an AUC of 0.89. It also demonstrated\n35% faster training and 25% fewer parameters, highlighting computational\nefficiency. These findings showcase the potential of quantum-enhanced\ntransformers to advance biomedical data analysis, enabling more accurate\ndiagnostics and personalized medicine."}

In this process, MutS homologs (MSH)\nplay crucial roles in identifying mismatched basepairs and recruiting\ndownstream MMR proteins. The MSH protein exhibits distinct functions and\ndiffusion dynamics before and after the recognition of mismatches while\ntraversing along DNA. An ADP-bound MSH, known as the MSH searching clamp, scans\nDNA sequences via rotational diffusion along the DNA backbone. Upon recognizing\na mismatch, the MSH combines with ATP molecules, forming a stable sliding\nclamp. Recent experimental evidence challenges the conventional view that the\nsliding clamp performs a simple Brownian motion. In this study, we explore the\ndiffusion dynamics of the ATP-bound MSH sliding clamp through single-particle\ntracking experiments and introduce a Bayesian single-trajectory modeling\nframework to analyze its motion. Our quantitative analysis reveals that the\ndiffusion characteristics defy explanation by a single-state diffusion\nmechanism. Instead, our in-depth model inference uncovers three distinct\ndiffusion states, each characterized by specific diffusion coefficients. These\nstates alternate over time, with cross-state transitions predominantly\ninvolving one intermediate state, and direct transitions between the slowest\nand the fastest states being scarce. We propose that these multi-state dynamics\nreflect underlying conformational changes in the MSH sliding clamp,\nhighlighting a more intricate diffusion mechanism than previously appreciated."}

We do not have theoretical frameworks that\nallow for such adaptability. As a result, we cannot understand emergent\nbehavior in living systems where structure formation and non-equilibrium drive\ncoevolve. Here, using ecosystems as a model of adaptive systems, we develop a\nframework of living circuits whose architecture changes adaptively with the\nenergy dissipated in each circuit edge. We find that unlike traditional\nnonequilibrium systems, living circuits exhibit a phase transition from\nequilibrium death to a nonequilibrium dissipative state beyond a critical\ndriving potential. This transition emerges through a feedback mechanism that\nsaves the weakest edges by routing dissipation through them, even though the\nadaptive rule locally rewards the strongest dissipating edges. Despite lacking\nany global optimization principle, living circuits achieve near-maximal\ndissipation, with higher drive promoting more complex circuits. Our work\nestablishes ecosystems as paradigmatic examples of living circuits whose\nstructure and dissipation are tuned through local adaptive rules."}

Using a\ngeneralized Lotka-Volterra framework with environmental covariates, we quantify\ntemporal rewiring of interspecific interactions, asymmetry patterns, and\nstructural stability. Our results reveal contrasting dynamics across\necosystems: in datasets with rich temporal resolution, interaction networks\nexhibit marked rewiring and shifts in cooperation-competition ratios that\ncorrelate with environmental stress, consistent, though not always linearly,\nwith the stress-gradient hypothesis. Conversely, in datasets with coarser\ntemporal sampling, networks retain constant interaction sign structure and\nremain in cooperation-dominated regimes.

While recent advances have clarified many of the underlying\nprocesses, how these mechanisms interact to shape ecosystem dynamics under\nenvironmental stress is not yet understood. Here, we present and analyze a\nminimalistic spatially extended model of tree-grass dynamics in dry savannas.\nWe incorporate tree facilitation of grasses through shading and grass competing\nwith trees for water, both varying with tree life stage. Our model shows that\nthese mechanisms lead to grass-tree coexistence and bistability between savanna\nand grassland states. Moreover, the model predicts vegetation patterns\nconsisting of trees and grasses, particularly under harsh environmental\nconditions, which can persist in situations where a non-spatial version of the\nmodel predicts ecosystem collapse from savanna to grassland instead (a\nphenomenon called ''Turing-evades-tipping''). Additionally, we identify a novel\n''Turing-triggers-tipping'' mechanism, where unstable pattern formation drives\ntipping events that are overlooked when spatial dynamics are not included.\nThese transient patterns act as early warning signals for ecosystem\ntransitions, offering a critical window for intervention. Further theoretical\nand empirical research is needed to determine when spatial patterns prevent\ntipping or drive collapse."}
