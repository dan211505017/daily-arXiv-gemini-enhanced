Currently, this analysis is often performed in a two-stage\nprocedure, which is prone to errors in uncertainty propagation and estimation.\nWe propose an approach derived from a Bayesian hierarchical model that\nintrinsically propagates uncertainties and operates on the full data to\nmaximize the precision at minimal uncertainty. In an analytic treatment, we\nreduce the estimation procedure to a least-squares optimization problem which\ncan be understood as an extension of the Variable Projection (VarPro) approach\nfor data scenarios with two predictors. We investigate the method's efficacy in\ntwo experiments with hyperpolarized metabolites recorded with conventional\nhigh-field NMR devices and a micronscale NMR setup using Nitrogen-Vacancy\ncenters in diamond for detection, respectively. In both examples, the new\napproach improves estimates compared to Fourier methods and proves operational\nadvantages over a two-stage procedure employing VarPro. While the approach\npresented is motivated by NMR analysis, it is straightforwardly applicable to\nfurther estimation scenarios with similar data structure, such as time-resolved\nphotospectroscopy."}

Methods: PACG patients with >5 reliable VF\ntests over >5 years were included. Progression was assessed in Zeiss Forum,\nwith baseline VF within six months of OCT. Fast progression was VFI decline\n<-2.0% per year; slow progression >-2.0% per year. OCT volumes were\nAI-segmented to extract 31 ONH parameters. The Glaucoma Hemifield Test defined\nfive regions per hemifield, aligned with RNFL distribution. Mean sensitivity\nper region was combined with structural parameters to train ML classifiers.\nMultiple models were tested, and SHAP identified key predictors. Main outcome\nmeasures: Classification of slow versus fast progressors using combined\nstructural and functional data. Results: We analyzed 451 eyes from 299\npatients. Mean VFI progression was -0.92% per year; 369 eyes progressed slowly\nand 82 rapidly. The Random Forest model combining structural and functional\nfeatures achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.87, 2000 Monte Carlo\niterations). SHAP identified six key predictors: inferior MRW, inferior and\ninferior-temporal RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, superior nasal\nVF sensitivity, and inferior RNFL and GCL+IPL thickness. Models using only\nstructural or functional features performed worse with AUC of 0.82 and 0.78,\nrespectively. Conclusions: Combining ONH structural and VF functional\nparameters significantly improves classification of progression risk in PACG.\nInferior ONH features, MRW and RNFL thickness, were the most predictive,\nhighlighting the critical role of ONH morphology in monitoring disease\nprogression."}

However,\nmany current methods suffer from limited quality, high computational demands,\nand complexity for non-experts. Furthermore, common evaluation strategies for\nsynthetic data often fail to directly reflect statistical utility. Against this\nbackground, a critical underexplored question is whether synthetic data can\nreliably reproduce key findings from epidemiological research. We propose the\nuse of adversarial random forests (ARF) as an efficient and convenient method\nfor synthesizing tabular epidemiological data. To evaluate its performance, we\nreplicated statistical analyses from six epidemiological publications and\ncompared original with synthetic results. These publications cover blood\npressure, anthropometry, myocardial infarction, accelerometry, loneliness, and\ndiabetes, based on data from the German National Cohort (NAKO\nGesundheitsstudie), the Bremen STEMI Registry U45 Study, and the Guelph Family\nHealth Study. Additionally, we assessed the impact of dimensionality and\nvariable complexity on synthesis quality by limiting datasets to variables\nrelevant for individual analyses, including necessary derivations. Across all\nreplicated original studies, results from multiple synthetic data replications\nconsistently aligned with original findings. Even for datasets with relatively\nlow sample size-to-dimensionality ratios, the replication outcomes closely\nmatched the original results across various descriptive and inferential\nanalyses. Reducing dimensionality and pre-deriving variables further enhanced\nboth quality and stability of the results."}

Classic models derived\nfrom the bacteria E. coli posit that protein-synthesis rates are set by\nmass-action collisions between charged tRNAs produced by metabolic enzymes and\nmRNA-bound ribosomes. These models show that faster growth is achieved by\nsimultaneously raising both ribosome content and peptide elongation speed.\nHere, we test if these models are valid for eukaryotes by combining\nsingle-molecule tracking, spike-in RNA sequencing, and proteomics in 15 carbon-\nand nitrogen-limited conditions using the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. Ribosome\nconcentration increases linearly with growth rate, as in bacteria, but the\npeptide elongation speed remains constant (~9 amino acids/s) and charged tRNAs\nare not limiting. Total mRNA concentration rises in direct proportion to\nribosomes, driven by enhanced RNA polymerase II occupancy of the genome. We\nshow that a simple kinetic model of mRNA-ribosome binding predicts both the\nfraction of active ribosomes, the growth rate, and responses to transcriptional\nperturbations. Yeast accelerate growth by coordinately and proportionally\nco-up-regulating total mRNA and ribosome concentrations, not by speeding\nelongation.

To bridge this gap, we here develop a bottom-up physical model that\nexplicitly incorporates these two fundamental cell-level drivers of protein\naggregation dynamics. We show that our model naturally explains the\ncharacteristic long, slow development of pathology followed by a rapid\nacceleration, a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, the\nmodel reveals the existence of a critical switch point at which the system's\ndynamics transition from being dominated by slow, spontaneous formation of\ndiseased cells to being driven by fast propagation.
