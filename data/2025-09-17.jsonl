While such\npatterns often exhibit remarkable robustness, variation and irregularity exist\nat multiple scales and can carry important information about the underlying\nagent interactions driving collective dynamics. Many methods for quantifying\nbiological patterns focus on large-scale, characteristic features (such as\nstripe width or spot number), but questions remain on how to characterize messy\npatterns. In the case of cellular patterns that emerge during development or\nregeneration, understanding where patterns are most susceptible to variability\nmay help shed light on cell behavior and the tissue environment. Motivated by\nthese challenges, we introduce methods based on topological data analysis to\nclassify and quantify messy patterns arising from agent-based interactions, by\nextracting meaningful biological interpretations from persistence barcode\nsummaries. To compute persistent homology, our methods rely on a sweeping-plane\nfiltration which, in comparison to the Vietoris--Rips filtration, is more\nrarely applied to biological systems. We demonstrate how results from the\nsweeping-plane filtration can be interpreted to quantify stripe patterns (with\nand without interruptions) by analyzing in silico zebrafish skin patterns, and\nwe generate new quantitative predictions about which pattern features may be\nmost robust or variable. Our work provides an automated framework for\nquantifying features and irregularities in spot and stripe patterns and\nhighlights how different approaches to persistent homology can provide\ncomplementary insight into biological systems."}

Effectively evading\nunexpected predator attacks is one primary task for many moving groups. The\ncurrent explanation for predator evasion responses in moving animal groups\nrequire the individuals in the groups interact via (velocity) alignment.\nHowever, experiments have shown that some animals do not use alignment. This\nsuggests that another explanation for the predator evasion capacity in at least\nthese species is needed. Here we establish that effective collective predator\nevasion does not require alignment, it can be induced via attraction and\nrepulsion alone. We also show that speed differences between individuals that\nhave directly observed the predator and those that have not influence evasion\nsuccess and the speed of the collective evasion process, but are not required\nto induce the phenomenon. Our work here adds collective predator evasion to a\nnumber of phenomena previously thought to require alignment interactions that\nhave recently been shown to emerge from attraction and repulsion alone.

In AI and artificial life, recent\nwork explores how language can specify high-level goals, but most systems still\ndepend on engineered rewards, task-specific supervision, or rigid command sets,\nlimiting generalization to novel instructions. Similar constraints apply in\nsynthetic biology and bioengineering, where the locus of control is often\ngenomic rather than environmental perturbation.\n  A key open question is whether artificial or biological collectives can be\nguided by free-form natural language alone, without task-specific tuning or\ncarefully designed evaluation metrics. We provide one possible answer here by\nshowing, for the first time, that simple agents' collective behavior can be\nguided by free-form language prompts: one AI model transforms an imperative\nprompt into an intervention that is applied to simulated cells; a second AI\nmodel scores how well the prompt describes the resulting cellular dynamics; and\nthe former AI model is evolved to improve the scores generated by the latter.\n  Unlike previous work, our method does not require engineered fitness\nfunctions or domain-specific prompt design.

In evolutionary game theory, a key challenge is to\nidentify strategies that harness such memory to succeed in repeated encounters.\nDecades of research have identified influential one-step memory strategies\n(such as Tit-for-Tat, Generous Tit-for-Tat, and Win-Stay Lose-Shift) that\npromote cooperation in iterated pairwise games. However, these strategies\noccupy only a small corner of the vast strategy space, and performance in\nisolated pairwise contests does not guarantee evolutionary success. The most\neffective strategies are those that can spread through a population and\nstabilize cooperation. We propose a general framework for repeated-interaction\nstrategies that encompasses arbitrary memory lengths, diverse informational\ninputs (including both one's own and the opponent's past actions), and\ndeterministic or stochastic decision rules. We analyze their evolutionary\ndynamics and derive general mathematical results for the emergence of\ncooperation in any network structure.

Modeling the\ngenotype distribution is challenging, as it ultimately requires tracking all\ncorrelations (or cumulants) among alleles at different loci. The quasi-linkage\nequilibrium (QLE) approximation simplifies this by assuming that correlations\nbetween alleles at different loci are weak -- i.e., low linkage disequilibrium\n-- allowing their dynamics to be modeled perturbatively. However, QLE breaks\ndown under strong selection, significant epistatic interactions, or weak\nrecombination. We extend the multilocus QLE framework to allow cumulants up to\norder $K$ to evolve dynamically, while higher-order cumulants ($>K$) are\nassumed to equilibrate rapidly. This extended QLE (exQLE) framework yields a\ngeneral equation of motion for cumulants up to order $K$, which parallels the\nstandard QLE dynamics (recovered when $K = 1$). In this formulation, cumulant\ndynamics are driven by the gradient of average fitness, mediated by a\ngeometrically interpretable matrix that stems from competition among genotypes.\nOur analysis shows that the exQLE with $K=2$ accurately captures cumulant\ndynamics even when the fitness function includes higher-order (e.g., third- or\nfourth-order) epistatic interactions, capabilities that standard QLE lacks. We\nalso applied the exQLE framework to infer fitness parameters from temporal\nsequence data. Overall, exQLE provides a systematic and interpretable\napproximation scheme, leveraging analytical cumulant dynamics and reducing\ncomplexity by progressively truncating higher-order cumulants."}
