Due to its well-understood mechanism, many\nsiRNA-based drugs have been evaluated in clinical trials. However, selecting\neffective binding regions and designing siRNA sequences requires extensive\nexperimentation, making the process costly. As genomic resources and publicly\navailable siRNA datasets continue to grow, data-driven models can be leveraged\nto better understand siRNA-mRNA interactions. To fully exploit such data,\ncurating high-quality siRNA datasets is essential to minimize experimental\nerrors and noise. We propose siDPT: siRNA efficacy Prediction via Debiased\nPreference-Pair Transformer, a framework that constructs a preference-pair\ndataset and designs an siRNA-mRNA interactive transformer with debiased ranking\nobjectives to improve siRNA inhibition prediction and generalization. We\nevaluate our approach using two public datasets and one newly collected patent\ndataset. Our model demonstrates substantial improvement in Pearson correlation\nand strong performance across other metrics."}

Dalziel"], "title": "Epidemic amplification by correlated superspreading", "categories": ["q-bio.PE"], "comment": null, "summary": "Infectious pathogens often propagate by superspreading, which focusses onward\ntransmission on disproportionately few infected individuals. At the same time,\ninfector-infectee pairs tend to have more similar transmission potentials than\nexpected by chance, as risk factors assort among individuals who frequently\ninteract. A key problem for infectious disease epidemiology, and in the\ndynamics of complex systems, is to understand how structured variation in\nindividual transmission will scale to impact epidemic dynamics. Here we\nintroduce a framework that reveals how population structure shapes epidemic\nthresholds, through autocorrelation of individual reproductive numbers along\nchains of transmission. We show that chains of superspreading can sustain\nepidemics even when the average transmission rate in the host population is\nbelow one, and derive a mathematical threshold beyond which correlated\nsuperspreading allows epidemics in otherwise subcritical systems. Empirical\nanalysis of 47 transmission trees for 13 human pathogens indicate\nself-organizing bursts of superspreading are common and that many trees are\nnear the critical boundary. Vaccination campaigns that proceed up assortative\nhierarchies of transmission are predicted to sustain the force of infection\nuntil herd immunity is reached, providing a mechanistic basis for threshold\ndynamics observed in real-world settings. Conversely, modulating correlations\nin transmission, rather than mean or variance, could enable cities and other\ncomplex systems to develop immune-like capacities that suppress contagion while\npreserving core functions."}

In addition, they need to resist frequent attacks from a\nvariety of herbivores acting alone, in small groups, or in swarms. Since the\namount of energy a plant might invest in defense and reproduction is limited, a\ncomplex optimization problem emerges. In a shared habitat, plants fight\nherbivores by shape and camouflage, by the release of specific toxins, or by\nattracting predators of herbivores. Furthermore, plants alert their surrounding\nfield by signaling substances in the event of an assault. Transported by air or\nthrough a network of roots, signaling substances reach neighbors to trigger\ntheir defense. The offsprings of a plant commonly grow within a certain\ndistance to benefit from symbiotic protection. We introduce a grid-based visual\nsimulation software for detailed configuration and subsequent processing of the\nbehavior of the resulting system in time and space. In terms of solution to a\ncomputational optimization problem inspired by nature, settings with low energy\nneed and long life able to cope with different patterns of attack can be\nfigured out and analyzed. Applications include novel techniques for efficient\nconstruction and secure operation of sensor networks."}

Thus far most\nevolutionary theory concerns the genetics of aging with limited physiological\nintegration. Here we present an intuitive evolutionary framework built on how\nphysiology is regulated and how this regulation itself is then predicted to\nage. Life has evolved to secure reproduction and avoid system failure in early\nlife, and it is the physiological regulation that evolves in response to those\nearly life selection pressures that leads to the emergence of aging.\nImportantly, asymmetrical regulation of physiology will evolve as the Darwinian\nfitness costs of loss of regulation will not be symmetrical. When asymmetrical\nregulatory systems break during aging, they cause physiological function to\ndrift towards the physiological range where costs of dysregulation are lowest,\nrendering aging directional. Our model explains many puzzling aspects of the\nbiology of aging. These include why aging appears (but is not) programmed, why\naging is gradual yet heterogeneous, why cellular and hormonal signaling are\nclosely related to aging, the compensation law of mortality, why trade-offs\nbetween reproduction and aging remain elusive, why longer-lived organisms show\nmore signs of aging during their natural lifespans, and why longer-lived\norganisms can be less responsive to treatments of aging that work well in\nshort-lived organisms. We provide predictions of our theory that are\nempirically testable. By incorporating physiological regulation into\nevolutionary models of aging, we provide a novel perspective to guide empirical\nresearch in this still growing field."}

A long-held view in the field is that it is not possible\nto capture its three facets -- functional richness, functional divergence, and\nfunctional evenness -- in a single index. This perspective has prompted recent\nproposals for FD measurement to use three separate indices, one for each\naspect. Here, we challenge this paradigm by demonstrating that the\nprobability-weighted Vendi Score (pVS), first introduced by Friedman and Dieng\n(2023), can serve as a powerful functional diversity index that can capture its\nthree facets. We adapt pVS to functional ecology by defining it as the\nexponential of the R\\'enyi entropy of the eigenvalues of the abundance-weighted\ntrait similarity matrix. This formulation allows pVS to be applicable at any\nbiological level. It can be defined at the species level, at which most\nexisting FD metrics are defined, and at the individual level to naturally\nincorporate intraspecific trait variation (ITV) when detailed data are\navailable. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate the robustness of pVS.\nWe first mathematically prove it satisfies several essential desiderata for FD\nmetrics, including invariance to functional redundancy, set monotonicity,\ndistance monotonicity, and concavity. We then show that pVS consistently\nexhibits the expected ground-truth behavior on simulated ecosystem scenarios\nunder which many FD metrics fail. By integrating abundances and trait\nsimilarities within a single, theoretically sound framework, pVS provides a\ngenerally applicable index for ecology."}

These curves are often\nshown without error bands, and even when error bands are provided, they\ntypically only account for the statistical uncertainty resulting from the\nfinite number of patients in the study. In reality, other sources of\nuncertainty affect the measurements as well. As datasets grow, the statistical\nuncertainty on the number of patients no longer dominates the overall\nuncertainty, and other uncertainties are increasingly important to model. The\nKoMbine package, developed based on procedures used in particle physics,\nprovides the first method to propagate both statistical and systematic\nuncertainties through the Kaplan--Meier curve estimation processes."}

Variability stems from biological differences, PCR\namplification bias, limited sequencing depth, and low capture efficiency,\nmaking it challenging to adapt computational pipelines to heterogeneous\ndatasets or evolving technologies. As a result, most studies still rely on\nprincipal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, valued for its\ninterpretability and robustness. Here, we improve upon PCA with a Random Matrix\nTheory (RMT)-based approach that guides the inference of sparse principal\ncomponents using existing sparse PCA algorithms. We first introduce a novel\nbiwhitening method, inspired by the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, that\nsimultaneously stabilizes variance across genes and cells. This enables the use\nof an RMT-based criterion to automatically select the sparsity level, rendering\nsparse PCA nearly parameter-free. Our mathematically grounded approach retains\nthe interpretability of PCA while enabling robust, hands-off inference of\nsparse principal components. Across seven single-cell RNA-seq technologies and\nfour sparse PCA algorithms, we show that this method systematically improves\nthe reconstruction of the principal subspace and consistently outperforms PCA-,\nautoencoder-, and diffusion-based methods in cell-type classification tasks."}

We present a\nframework that recasts modeling choices as testable mechanistic hypotheses and\nsupplies a simple protocol for rejecting inappropriate model specifications,\nsuch as under-/over-parameterization or invalid simplifying assumptions, based\non predefined criteria before any parameter inference. The key idea is expected\nmodel behavior under feature generalization constraints: instead of judging a\nmodel solely by how well it fits a specific target feature of interest Y at an\noptimal parameter set, we evaluate the model's expected Y output when the model\nis constrained to reproduce a broader, or distinct, feature Z over the entire\nparameter space. We then assess whether a mirror statistical model, derived\nfrom the model's expected Y outputs, to the empirical statistical model using\nstandard statistics.
