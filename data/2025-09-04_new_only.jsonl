The Friend or Foe datasets are curated for a wide range of\nmachine learning tasks -- supervised, unsupervised, and generative -- to\naddress specific questions underlying bacterial interactions.

We present a model of gradient sensing where the affinity of\nreceptor-ligand binding is increased when a protein binds to the receptor's\ncytosolic side. This interior protein (allosteric factor) alters the\nsensitivity of the cell, allowing the cell to adapt to different ligand\nconcentrations. We propose a reaction scheme where the cell alters the\nallosteric factor's availability to adapt the average fraction of bound\nreceptors to 1/2. We calculate bounds on the chemotactic accuracy of the cell,\nand find that the cell can reach near-optimal chemotaxis over a broad range of\nconcentrations.

Aquatic size spectra generally show a\nlog-linearly downtrending shape, following a power-law distribution. A constant\nlog-linear slope has been reported for many marine pelagic ecosystems, often\nbeing approximately b = -1. Conversely, there are variable\ntrophic-level-biomass relationships (trophic pyramids). The contrasting\nobservations of a constant biomass (M) spectrum slope and highly variable\nbiomass pyramids may be defined as the constant size spectra-variable trophic\ndynamics paradox. Here, a 'mass-specific predator-prey-efficiency theory of\nsize spectra' (PETS) is presented and discussed. A thorough analysis of\navailable data, literature and models result in the conclusion that most\npelagic marine ecosystems are controlled by trophic processes such as\nresource-limit stress (bottom-up control) and top-down regulation, with a key\nrole of the maximum carrying capacity of large-sized organisms.

Conjugative plasmids are ubiquitous mobile\ngenetic elements that mediate such exchanges both within and between species.\nTherefore, predicting whether a plasmid can invade and be maintained by a\nmicrobial community is critical, for example when assessing the risks of\nantimicrobial resistance gene spread in commensal or environmental microbiomes.\nHowever, existing theory developed to assist such predictions has generally\nfocused on the balance among plasmid costs, benefits, and infection rates,\noverlooking other relevant factors such as the inherent dynamics and diversity\nof microbiomes. Here, we hypothesize that plasmid persistence in the absence of\npositive selection can arise purely from the heterogeneity present in large and\ndiverse microbial communities. We introduce a generic model that integrates\npopulation-level dynamics with plasmid conjugation. Using this model, we show\nthat we can predict plasmid maintenance, and that the probability for a plasmid\nto be maintained depends on traits of the plasmid, most importantly the\nconjugation rate, and the species abundance distribution of the community.\nThen, using both empirical abundance data and extensive numerical simulations,\nwe demonstrate that the inherent randomness of ecological interactions and\nconjugation rates enables plasmid persistence -- even in the absence of\npositive selection. Our findings thus suggest that natural microbial\ncommunities are likely to maintain plasmids indefinitely, offering a new\nperspective on the spread, maintenance, and ubiquity of plasmids."}

Despite low signal-to-noise ratio\nin reconstructed volumes, the large number of copies of the same macromolecules\nmakes it possible to retrieve high-resolution maps by averaging many aligned\nsubtomograms. To keep up with technical advances in the imaging process and the\nresulting huge amounts of data available, there is a need for scalable, fast\nand robust procedures to align subtomograms.

Review article\n  submitted to Global Change Biology", "summary": "Many ecosystems can undergo important qualitative changes, including sudden\ntransitions to alternative stable states, in response to perturbations or\nincrements in conditions. Such 'tipping points' are often preceded by declines\nin aspects of ecosystem resilience, namely the capacity to recover from\nperturbations, that leave various spatial and temporal signatures. These\nso-called 'early warning signals' have been used to anticipate transitions in\ndiverse real systems, but many of the high-throughput, autonomous monitoring\ntechnologies that are transforming ecology have yet to be fully leveraged to\nthis end. Acoustic monitoring in particular is a powerful tool for quantifying\nbiodiversity, tracking ecosystem health, and facilitating conservation. By\ndeploying acoustic recorders in diverse environments, researchers have gained\ninsights from the calls and behaviour of individual species to higher-level\nsoundscape features that describe habitat quality and even predict species\noccurrence. Here, we draw on theory and practice to advocate for using\nacoustics to probe ecosystem resilience and identify emerging and established\nearly warning signals of tipping points. With a focus on pragmatic\nconsiderations, we emphasise that despite limits to tipping point theory and\nthe current scale and transferability of data, acoustics could be instrumental\nin understanding resilience and tipping potential across distinct ecosystems\nand scales."}

Their ability to generate\nhigh-quality samples has extended beyond high-dimensional image data to other\ncomplex domains such as proteins, where data distributions are typically sparse\nand unevenly spread. Importantly, the sparsity itself is uneven. Empirically,\nwe observed that while a small fraction of samples lie in dense clusters, the\nmajority occupy regions of varying sparsity across the data space. Existing\napproaches largely ignore this data-dependent variability. In this work, we\nintroduce a Data-Dependent Smoothing Walk-Jump framework that employs kernel\ndensity estimation (KDE) as a preprocessing step to estimate the noise scale\n$\\sigma$ for each data point, followed by training a score model with these\ndata-dependent $\\sigma$ values. By incorporating local data geometry into the\ndenoising process, our method accounts for the heterogeneous distribution of\nprotein data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach yields\nconsistent improvements across multiple metrics, highlighting the importance of\ndata-aware sigma prediction for generative modeling in sparse, high-dimensional\nsettings."}

How these properties evolve is not well understood because\nthey emerge from a complex interplay between beliefs and behaviors that are\nusually modeled separately. Here we address this challenge by developing a\ngame-theoretical framework incorporating norm-utility models to study the\ncoevolutionary dynamics of cooperative action, expressed belief, and\nnorm-utility preferences. We show that the introduction of evolving beliefs and\npreferences into the Snowdrift game and Prisoner's Dilemma leads to a\nproliferation of evolutionary stable equilibria, each with different societal\nproperties. In particular, we find that a declining material environment can\nsimultaneously be associated with increased cultural tightness (defined as the\ndegree to which individuals behave in accordance with widely held beliefs) and\nreduced social cohesion (defined as the degree of social homogeneity i.e. the\nextent to which individuals belong to a single well-defined group). Loss of\nsocial homogeneity occurs via a process of evolutionary branching, in which a\npopulation fragments into two distinct social groups with strikingly different\ncharacteristics. The groups that emerge differ not only in their willingness to\ncooperate, but also in their beliefs about cooperation and in their preferences\nfor conformity and coherence of their actions and beliefs. These results have\nimplications for our understanding of the resilience of cooperation and\ncollective action in times of crisis."}
