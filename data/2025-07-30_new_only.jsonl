Deep learning integration into\nstructural proteomics workflows addresses longstanding challenges including low\nsignal-to-noise ratios, preferred orientation artifacts, and missing-wedge\nproblems that historically limited efficiency and scalability. This review\nexamines AI applications across the entire cryoEM pipeline, from automated\nparticle picking using convolutional neural networks (Topaz, crYOLO,\nCryoSegNet) to computational solutions for preferred orientation bias\n(spIsoNet, cryoPROS) and advanced denoising algorithms (Topaz-Denoise). In\ncryoET, tools like IsoNet employ U-Net architectures for simultaneous\nmissing-wedge correction and noise reduction, while TomoNet streamlines\nsubtomogram averaging through AI-driven particle detection. The workflow\nculminates with automated atomic model building using sophisticated tools like\nModelAngelo, DeepTracer, and CryoREAD that translate density maps into\ninterpretable biological structures. These AI-enhanced approaches have achieved\nnear-atomic resolution reconstructions with minimal manual intervention,\nresolved previously intractable datasets suffering from severe orientation\nbias, and enabled successful application to diverse biological systems from HIV\nvirus-like particles to in situ ribosomal complexes.

In this study, we propose\nlikelihood-based methods grounded in multinomial logistic regression to infer\nboth stoichiometries and network connectivity structure from full time-series\ntrajectories of stochastic chemical reaction networks. When complete molecular\ncount trajectories are observed for all species, stoichiometric coefficients\nare identifiable, provided each reaction occurs at least once during the\nobservation window. However, identifying catalytic species remains difficult,\nas their molecular counts remain unchanged before and after each reaction\nevent. Through three illustrative stochastic models involving catalytic\ninteractions in open networks, we demonstrate that the logistic regression\nframework, when applied properly, can recover the full network structure,\nincluding stoichiometric relationships. We further apply Bayesian logistic\nregression to estimate model parameters in real-world epidemic settings, using\nthe COVID-19 outbreak in the Greater Seoul area of South Korea as a case study.\nOur analysis focuses on a Susceptible--Infected--Recovered (SIR) network model\nthat incorporates demographic effects. To address the challenge of partial\nobservability, particularly the availability of data only for the infectious\nsubset of the population, we develop a method that integrates Bayesian logistic\nregression with differential equation models.

This study evaluated muscle\nsynergies and coactivation patterns as indicators of neuromuscular coordination\nin lower-limb across three power levels of cycling. Twenty recreational\ncyclists performed a graded cycling test on a stationary bicycle ergometer.\nElectromyography was recorded bilaterally from seven lower-limb muscles and\nmuscle synergies were extracted using non-negative matrix factorization. The\nCoactivation Index (CI), Synergy Index (SI), and Synergy Coordination Index\n(SCI) were calculated to assess muscle coordination patterns. Four muscle\nsynergies were identified consistently across power levels, with changes in\nsynergy composition and activation timing correlated with increased muscular\ndemands. As power level increased, the CI showed reduced muscle coactivation at\nthe knee and greater muscle coactivation at the ankle. The SI revealed a\ngreater contribution of the synergy weights of the extensor muscles than those\nof the flexor muscles at the knee. In contrast, the relative EMG contribution\nof hip extensor and flexor muscles remained consistent with increasing power\nlevels. The SCI increased significantly with increasing power level, suggesting\na reduction in the size of the synergy space and improved neuromuscular\ncoordination.

We take here a network perspective to examine this possibility using\ndata on sexual partnerships, demographic data, PrEP usage, and syphilis among\nMSM in Columbus, Ohio. We use a recently developed community detection\nalgorithm, an adaptation of the community detection algorithm InfoMap to\nabsorbing random walks, to identify clusters of people (`communities') that may\ndrive syphilis transmission. Our community detection approach takes into\naccount both sexual partnerships as well as syphilis treatment rates when\ndetecting communities. We apply this algorithm to sexual networks fitted to\nempirical data from the Network Epidemiology of Syphilis Transmission (NEST)\nstudy in Columbus, Ohio. We assume that PrEP usage is associated with regular\nvisits to a sexual health provider, and thus is correlated with syphilis\ndetection and treatment rates. We examine how PrEP usage can affect community\nstructure in the sexual networks fitted to the NEST data. We identify two types\nof PrEP users, those belonging to a large, highly connected community and\ntending to have a large number of sexual partners, versus those with a small\nnumber of sexual partners and belonging to smaller communities. A stochastic\nsyphilis model indicates that PrEP users in the large community may play an\nimportant role in sustaining syphilis transmission."}
