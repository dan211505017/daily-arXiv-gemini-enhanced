Myocardial relaxation relies strongly on\nefficient intracellular calcium (${\\text{Ca}}^{2+}$) handling. During diastole,\na sluggish removal of ${\\text{Ca}}^{2+}$ from cardiomyocytes disrupts sarcomere\nrelaxation, leading to ILVR \\textit{at the organ level}. Characterizing\nmyocardial relaxation \\textit{at the cellular level} requires analyzing both\nsarcomere length (SL) transients and intracellular calcium kinetics (CK).\nHowever, due to the complexity and redundancy in SL and CK data, identifying\nthe most informative features for accurate classification is challenging. To\naddress this, we developed a robust feature selection pipeline involving\nstatistical significance testing (p-values), hierarchical clustering, and\nfeature importance evaluation using random forest (RF) classification to select\nthe most informative features from SL and CK data. SL and CK transients were\nobtained from prior studies involving a transgenic phospho-ablated mouse model\nexhibiting ILVR (AAA mice) and wild-type as non-transgenic control mice (NTG).\nBy iteratively refining the feature set, we trained a RF classifier using the\nselected reduced features. For comparison, we evaluated the performance of the\nclassifier using the full set of original features as well as a dimensionally\nreduced set derived through principal component analysis (PCA). The confusion\nmatrices demonstrated that the reduced feature set achieved comparable\nperformance to the full feature set and outperformed the PCA-based approach,\nwhile offering better interpretability by retaining biologically relevant\nfeatures. These findings suggest that a small, carefully chosen set of\nbiological features can effectively detect early signs of cardiomyocyte\ndysfunction."}

This bias may emerge at\nmultiple stages of the reconstruction pipeline, and in particular in the\ncritical particle picking stage, where 2D particles (in cryo-EM) or 3D\nsubtomograms (in cryo-ET) are extracted from highly noisy micrographs or\ntomograms. Focusing on two widely used methodologies, template matching and\ndeep neural networks, we combine theoretical analysis with controlled\nexperiments to demonstrate that both methods, when applied to pure noise, can\nproduce persistent molecular structures, a phenomenon we term structure from\nnoise. This artifact highlights a critical vulnerability in current workflows:\nthe potential for particle-picking algorithms to inject strong prior-driven\nbias into downstream analyses. We then propose practical mitigation strategies\nto reduce the impact of such biases. Together, our findings deepen the\ntheoretical understanding of confirmation bias in cryo-EM and cryo-ET and call\nfor cautious interpretation of reconstructions, primarily when relying on\ntemplate-driven particle picking."}

This\nmodel captures both heterogeneities in individuals mixing, contact frequency,\naptitude to contract and spread the infection, and endogenous behavioral\nresponses such as voluntary social distancing and the adoption of\nself-protective measures. We study the stability of the equilibria and\nillustrate through several examples how the shape of the stability region\ndepends on the structure of the interaction matrix, providing insights for the\ndesign of effective control strategies. We then analyze the transient behavior\nof the dynamics, showing that, for a special class of rank-1 interaction\nmatrices, there always exists an aggregate infection curve that exhibits a\nunimodal behavior, expanding the results on the unimodality of infection curve\nknown in the literature of epidemic models and paving the way for future\ncontrol applications."}

A challenge\nin mathematical biology, in particular, is that models are often complex and\nnon-identifiable, while data are limited. Rectifying identifiability through\nsimplification can seemingly yield more precise parameter estimates, albeit, as\nwe explore in this perspective, at the potentially catastrophic cost of\nintroducing model misspecification and poor accuracy. We demonstrate how\nuncertainty in model structure can be propagated through to uncertainty in\nparameter estimates using a semi-parametric Gaussian process approach that\ndelineates parameters of interest from uncertainty in model terms.\nSpecifically, we study generalised logistic growth with an unknown crowding\nfunction, and a spatially resolved process described by a partial differential\nequation with a time-dependent diffusivity parameter. Allowing for structural\nmodel uncertainty yields more robust and accurate parameter estimates, and a\nbetter quantification of remaining uncertainty. We conclude our perspective by\ndiscussing the connections between identifiability and model misspecification,\nand alternative approaches to dealing with model misspecification in\nmathematical biology."}
