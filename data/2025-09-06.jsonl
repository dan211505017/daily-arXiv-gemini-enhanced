Submitted to a Briefings in\n  Bioinformatics journal and waiting for the outcome", "summary": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a significant public health and economic\nchallenge, increasing treatment costs and reducing antibiotic effectiveness.\nThis study employs machine learning to analyze genomic and epidemiological data\nfrom the public databases for molecular typing and microbial genome diversity\n(PubMLST), incorporating data from UK government-supported AMR surveillance by\nthe Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland. We identify AMR patterns\nin Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli isolates collected in the UK\nfrom 2001 to 2017. The research integrates whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data,\nepidemiological metadata, and economic projections to identify key resistance\ndeterminants and forecast future resistance trends and healthcare costs. We\ninvestigate gyrA mutations for fluoroquinolone resistance and the tet(O) gene\nfor tetracycline resistance, training a Random Forest model validated with\nbootstrap resampling (1,000 samples, 95% confidence intervals), achieving 74%\naccuracy in predicting AMR phenotypes. Time-series forecasting models (SARIMA,\nSIR, and Prophet) predict a rise in campylobacteriosis cases, potentially\nexceeding 130 cases per 100,000 people by 2050, with an economic burden\nprojected to surpass 1.9 billion GBP annually if left unchecked. An enhanced\nRandom Forest system, analyzing 6,683 isolates, refines predictions by\nincorporating temporal patterns, uncertainty estimation, and resistance trend\nmodeling, indicating sustained high beta-lactam resistance, increasing\nfluoroquinolone resistance, and fluctuating tetracycline resistance."}

Despite the\nremarkable success of this approach, it remains unclear how to use such finely\ntuned models to study complex biological systems composed of numerous\nheterogeneous, interacting components. One possible strategy for taming this\nbiological complexity is to embrace the idea that many biological behaviors we\nobserve are ``typical'' and can be modeled using random systems that respect\nbiologically-motivated constraints. Here, we review recent works showing how\nthis approach can be used to make close connection with experiments in\nbiological systems ranging from neuroscience to ecology and evolution and\nbeyond. Collectively, these works suggest that the ``random-with-constraints''\nparadigm represents a promising new modeling strategy for capturing\nexperimentally observed dynamical and statistical features in high-dimensional\nbiological data and provides a powerful minimal modeling philosophy for\nbiology."}

Traditional memory-based strategies\nthat focus on recent interactions have yielded valuable insights into the\nevolution of cooperative behavior. However, as memory length increases, the\ncomplexity of analysis grows exponentially, since these strategies need to map\nevery possible action sequence of a given length to subsequent responses. Due\nto their inherent reliance on exhaustive mapping and a lack of explicit\ninformation processing, it remains unclear how individuals can handle extensive\ninteraction histories to make decisions under cognitive constraints. To fill\nthis gap, we introduce coordinated reciprocity strategies ($CORE$), which\nincrementally evaluate the entire game history by tallying instances of\nconsistent actions between individuals without storing round-to-round details.\nOnce this consistency index surpasses a threshold, $CORE$ prescribes\ncooperation. Through equilibrium analysis, we derive an analytical condition\nunder which $CORE$ constitutes an equilibrium. Moreover, our numerical results\nshow that $CORE$ effectively promotes cooperation between variants of itself,\nand it outperforms a range of existing strategies including memory-$1$,\nmemory-$2$, and those from a documented strategy library in evolutionary\ndynamics. Our work thus underscores the pivotal role of cumulative action\nconsistency in enhancing cooperation, developing robust strategies, and\noffering cognitively low-burden information processing mechanisms in repeated\nsocial dilemmas."}

However, many\nhesitated to take the vaccine due to concerns about its effectiveness. By\nlooking at an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of disease spread that\nincorporates a mass vaccination program, this study aims to determine the\nsensitivity of the cumulative count of infected individuals ($W$) and the\ncumulative death count ($D$) to the following model parameters: disease\ntransmission rate ($\\beta$), reciprocal of the disease latency period\n($\\kappa$), reciprocal of the infectious period ($\\gamma$), death ratio\n($\\alpha$), vaccine efficacy rate ($r$), and vaccine rollout rate ($\\delta$).\nThis was implemented using Latin hypercube sampling and partial rank\ncorrelation coefficient. Results show that $D$ is highly sensitive to $\\alpha$\nand shows increasing sensitivity to $\\delta$ in the long run. On the other\nhand, $W$ is highly sensitive to $\\kappa$ at the beginning of the simulation,\nbut this weakens over time. In contrast, $W$ is not very sensitive to $\\delta$\ninitially but becomes very significant in the long run. This supports the\nimportance of the vaccine rollout rate over the vaccine efficacy rate in\ncurbing the spread of the disease in the population. It is also worthwhile to\nreduce the death ratio by developing a cure for the disease or improving the\nhealthcare system as a whole."}

This paper proposes a method\nfor steering the dynamics of a classic artificial chemistry model, known as\nAlChemy (Algorithmic Chemistry), which is based on untyped lambda calculus. Our\napproach leverages features that are endogenous to AlChemy without constructing\nan explicit external fitness function or building learning into the dynamics.\nWe demonstrate the approach by synthesizing non-trivial lambda functions, such\nas Church addition and succession, from simple primitives. The results provide\ninsight into the possibility of endogenous selection in diverse systems such as\nautocatalytic chemical networks and software systems."}
