This study focuses on segmenting unstained\nlive cells imaged with bright-field microscopy. While many segmentation\napproaches exist for microscopic images, none consistently address the\nchallenges of bright-field live-cell imaging with high throughput, where\ntemporal phenotype changes, low contrast, noise, and motion-induced blur from\ncellular movement remain major obstacles. We developed a low-cost CNN-based\npipeline incorporating comparative analysis of frozen encoders within a unified\nU-Net architecture enhanced with attention mechanisms, instance-aware systems,\nadaptive loss functions, hard instance retraining, dynamic learning rates,\nprogressive mechanisms to mitigate overfitting, and an ensemble technique. The\nmodel was validated on a public dataset featuring diverse live cell variants,\nshowing consistent competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods, achieving 93%\ntest accuracy and an average F1-score of 89% (std. 0.07) on low-contrast,\nnoisy, and blurry images. Notably, the model was trained primarily on\nbright-field images with limited exposure to phase-contrast microscopy (<10%),\nyet it generalized effectively to the phase-contrast LIVECell dataset,\ndemonstrating modality, robustness and strong performance. This highlights its\npotential for real-world laboratory deployment across imaging conditions. The\nmodel requires minimal compute power and is adaptable using basic deep learning\nsetups such as Google Colab, making it practical for training on other cell\nvariants. Our pipeline outperforms existing methods in robustness and precision\nfor bright-field microscopy segmentation. The code and dataset are available\nfor reproducibility"}

We\nintroduce piCurve, an R package that standardizes the modeling of PI\nrelationships, with a library of widely used light-limited, light-saturated,\nand photoinhibited formulations and a consistent statistical framework for\nestimation and comparison. With the total of 24 PI models, piCurve supports\nmean squared error (MSE) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), provides\nuncertainty quantification via information matrix (Hessian), and includes\nautomated, data-informed initialization to improve convergence. Utilities\nclassify PI data into light-limited, light-saturated, and photoinhibited\nregions, while plotting and 'tidy' helpers streamline workflow and reporting.\nTogether, these features enable reproducible analyses and fair model\ncomparisons, including for curves exhibiting a plateau followed by\nphotoinhibition."}

Detecting and\nquantifying this phenomenon is key to understanding evolution of traits ranging\nfrom multicellularity to pathogen virulence. Multilevel selection is\nparticularly important in artificial life research due to its connection to\nmajor evolutionary transitions, a hallmark of open-ended evolution. Bonetti\nFranceschi & Volz (2024) proposed to detect multilevel selection dynamics by\nscreening for mutations that appear more often in a population than expected by\nchance (due to individual-level fitness benefits) but are ultimately associated\nwith negative longer-term fitness outcomes (i.e., smaller, shorter-lived\ndescendant clades). Here, we use agent-based modeling with known ground truth\nto assess the efficacy of this approach. To test these methods under\nchallenging conditions broadly comparable to the original dataset explored by\nBonetti Franceschi & Volz (2024), we use an epidemiological framework to model\nmultilevel selection in trade-offs between within-host growth rate and\nbetween-host transmissibility. To achieve success on our in silico data, we\ndevelop an alternate normalization procedure for identifying clade-level\nfitness effects. We find the method to be sensitive in detecting genome sites\nunder multilevel selection with 30% effect sizes on fitness, but do not see\nsensitivity to smaller 10% mutation effect sizes. To test the robustness of\nthis methodology, we conduct additional experiments incorporating extrinsic,\ntime-varying environmental changes and adaptive turnover in population\ncompositions, and find that screen performance remains generally consistent\nwith baseline conditions. This work represents a promising step towards\nrigorous generalizable quantification of multilevel selection effects."}

This paper introduces a method that can efficiently analyze large\ndatasets to extract likely species associations. It tiles space into small\nblocks chosen to be of the accuracy of the data coordinates, and reduces\nobservations to presence/absence per tile, in order to compute pairwise\noverlaps. It compares these overlaps with a spatial Poisson process that serves\nas a null model. For each species $i$, an expected overlap $\\mu_i$ is estimated\nby averaging normalized overlaps over other species in the same vicinity. This\ngives a $z$-score for significance of a species-species association and a\ncorrelation index for the strength of this association. This was tested on\n$874,263$ iNaturalist observations spanning $15,975$ non-avian taxa in the\nSanta Cruz, California region ($\\approx 4.68\\times10^{6}$ tiles). The method\nrecovers well-known insect host-plant obligate relationships, particularly many\nhost-gall relationships, as well as the relationship between Yerba Santa\nBeetles and California Yerba Santa. This approach efficiently finds\nassociations on $\\sim10^{8}$ species pairs on modest hardware, filtering\ncorrelations arising from heterogeneous spatial prevalence and user artifacts.\nIt produces a ranked shortlist of ecological interactions that can be further\npursued. Extensions to this method are possible, such as investigating the\neffects of time and elevation. It could also be useful in the determination of\nmicrohabitats and biomes."}

Recent trends in climatic change,\ncharacterized by early and/or prolonged summer seasons, increased temperatures,\nand above-average rainfall, probably facilitated the spread of WNV in Europe,\nincluding Germany. In this work, we formulate a spatial WNV model consisting of\na system of parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), using the concept\nof diffusion and advection in combination with temperature-dependent\nparameters, i.e., mosquito biting rate, extrinsic incubation, and mortality\nrate. Diffusion represents the random movement of both mosquitoes and hosts\nacross space, while advection captures the directed movement of migratory\nbirds. The model is first studied mathematically, and we show that it has\nnon-negative, unique, and bounded solutions in time and space. Numerical\nsimulations of the PDE model are performed using temperature data for Germany\n(2019 - 2024). Results obtained from the simulation showed a high agreement\nwith the reported WNV cases among birds and equids in Germany. The observed\nspreading patterns from the year 2018 to 2022 and the year 2024 were mainly\ndriven by temperature in combination with diffusion processes of hosts and\nvectors. Only during the year 2023, the additional inclusion of advection for\nmigratory birds was important to correctly predict new hotspots in new\nlocations in Germany."}

We quantify how fluctuations in internal\nvariables that influence both growth and division shape the distribution of\npopulation phenotypes. We derive conditions under which the distributions of\nsize and internal state decouple. Under this decoupling, population--level\nexpectations are obtained from lineage-level expectations by an exponential\ntilting given by the Feynman--Kac formula. We further characterize weaker\n(ensemble-specific) versions of decoupling that hold in the lineage or the\npopulation ensemble but not both.
