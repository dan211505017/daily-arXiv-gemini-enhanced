A major bottleneck for drug discovery is the lack\nof functional annotation for more than 90 percent of the W. bancrofti dark\nproteome, leaving many potential targets unidentified. In this work, we present\na novel computational pipeline that converts W. bancrofti's unannotated amino\nacid sequence data into precise four-level Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers and\ndrug candidates. We utilized a DEtection TRansformer to estimate the\nprobability of enzymatic function, fine-tuned a hierarchical nearest neighbor\nEC predictor on 4,476 labeled parasite proteins, and applied rejection sampling\nto retain only four-level EC classifications at 100 percent confidence. This\npipeline assigned precise EC numbers to 14,772 previously uncharacterized\nproteins and discovered 543 EC classes not previously known in W. bancrofti. A\nqualitative triage emphasizing parasite-specific targets, chemical\ntractability, biochemical importance, and biological plausibility prioritized\nsix enzymes across five separate strategies: anti-Wolbachia cell-wall\ninhibition, proteolysis blockade, transmission disruption, purinergic immune\ninterference, and cGMP-signaling destabilization. We curated a 43-compound\nlibrary from ChEMBL and BindingDB and co-folded across multiple protein\nconformers with Boltz-2. All six targets exhibited at least moderately strong\npredicted binding affinities below 1 micromolar, with moenomycin analogs\nagainst peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase and NTPase inhibitors showing\npromising nanomolar hits and well-defined binding pockets. While experimental\nvalidation remains essential, our results provide the first large-scale\nfunctional map of the W. bancrofti dark proteome and accelerate early-stage\ndrug development for the species."}

Although contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) with full\nmulti-phase acquisition is recommended in clinical guidelines and routinely\nperformed in many tertiary centers, complete phase coverage is not consistently\navailable across all institutions. In practice, single-phase portal venous (PV)\nscans are often used alone, particularly in settings with limited imaging\nresources, variations in acquisition protocols, or patient-related factors such\nas contrast intolerance or motion artifacts. This variability results in a\nmismatch between idealized model assumptions and the practical constraints of\nreal-world deployment, underscoring the need for methods that can effectively\nleverage limited multi-phase data. To address this challenge, we propose a\nDual-Branch Prototype-guided (DuoProto) framework that enhances ER prediction\nfrom single-phase CT by leveraging limited multi-phase data during training.\nDuoProto employs a dual-branch architecture: the main branch processes\nsingle-phase images, while the auxiliary branch utilizes available multi-phase\nscans to guide representation learning via cross-domain prototype alignment.\nStructured prototype representations serve as class anchors to improve feature\ndiscrimination, and a ranking-based supervision mechanism incorporates\nclinically relevant recurrence risk factors. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat DuoProto outperforms existing methods, particularly under class imbalance\nand missing-phase conditions. Ablation studies further validate the\neffectiveness of the dual-branch, prototype-guided design.

Native mass spectrometry meets these criteria but\ntypically struggles with homooligomeric complexes due to overlapping mass\nsignals. To overcome this, we resolve monomer/dimer contributions to\noverlapping MS-peaks by separately analyzing the charge state distribution of\neach oligomeric species via sample dilution and covalent crosslinking.\nFollowing this approach, we show that quantitative Laser-Induced Liquid Bead\nIon Desorption mass spectrometry (qLILBID-MS) accurately captures the\naffinities of Bovine Serum Albumin and chemically induced dimers of\nTryparedoxin, an oxidoreductase from human pathogenic Trypanosoma brucei\nparasites, with various molecular glues and homodimer affinities.

Classical demographic theory predicts that volatility in growth should\ndecline rapidly with size due to the averaging effects of the law of large\nnumbers. As such, while small-scale societies may be demographically fragile,\nlarge-scale societies should be much more stable. Using a large census dataset\nof 228 indigenous societies from Brazil, we show that this prediction does not\nhold. Instead of volatility declining as the square root of population size, it\nfalls much more slowly. This means that individuals within communities do not\nbehave as independent demographic units as their lives are correlated through\ncooperation, shared subsistence practices, overlapping land use, and exposure\nto common shocks such as disease outbreaks or failed harvests. These\ncorrelations build demographic synchrony, drastically reducing the effective\ndemographic degrees of freedom in a population, keeping volatility higher than\nexpected at all scales. As a result, large-scale populations fluctuate as if\nthey were much smaller, increasing their vulnerability to collapse. This helps\nexplain why human societies of all sizes seem vulnerable to collapse, and why\nthe archaeological and historical record is filled with examples of large,\ncomplex societies collapsing despite their size. We suggest demographic\nsynchrony provides a general mechanism for understanding why human populations\nremain vulnerable across all scales: Scale still stabilizes synchronous\npopulations via density increases, but synchrony ensures that stability grows\nonly slowly with size, leaving large populations more volatile, and more\nvulnerable, than classical demographic theory predicts."}
