Design:\nRetrospective cohort study of 1,310 subjects contributing 43,849 Spectralis ONH\nOCT circle scans (1,331 glaucomatous and 867 healthy eyes) from the DIGS and\nADAGES cohorts. Methods: A MM-LLM (Llama 3.2 Vision-Instruct model) was\nfine-tuned to generate clinical descriptions of OCT imaging data. Training data\nincluded paired OCT images and automatically generated, structured clinical\nreports that described global and sectoral RNFL thinning. Poor-quality scans\nwere labeled as unusable and paired with a fixed refusal statement. The model\nwas evaluated on a held-out test set for three tasks: quality assessment,\nglaucoma detection, and RNFL thinning classification across seven anatomical\nsectors. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,\nprecision, and F1-score. Model description quality was also evaluated using\nstandard text evaluation metrics. Results: The model achieved 0.90 accuracy and\n0.98 specificity for quality triage. For glaucoma detection, accuracy was 0.86\n(sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.73, F1-score 0.91). RNFL thinning prediction\naccuracy ranged from 0.83 to 0.94, with highest performance in global and\ntemporal sectors. Text generation scores showed strong alignment with reference\nreports (BLEU: 0.82; ROUGE-1: 0.94; ROUGE-2: 0.87; ROUGE-L: 0.92; BERTScore-F1:\n0.99). Conclusions: The fine-tuned MM-LLM generated accurate clinical\ndescriptions based on OCT imaging. The model achieved high accuracy in\nidentifying image quality issues and detecting glaucoma. The model also\nprovided sectoral descriptions of RNFL thinning to help support clinical OCT\nevaluation."}

Individuals\nwith low vision often develop adaptive strategies to compensate for visual\ndeficits, relying on head movements to bring objects into their remaining\nfunctional field of vision. Research suggests that they focus on road surface\nmarkings and building edges to aid in wayfinding and collision avoidance.\nHowever, urban navigation presents additional challenges, as obstacles, moving\nhazards, and tripping dangers may enter their visual loss field, increasing the\nrisk of injury. Traditional eye movement studies are typically conducted in\ncontrolled laboratory settings with fixed head positions, limiting the\nunderstanding of head-eye coordination in real-world environments. To bridge\nthis gap, we designed a naturalistic, \"free-head\" experiment using eye-tracking\ntechnology to examine head and eye movement patterns during urban navigation.\nParticipants with low vision were compared to a control cohort without visual\nimpairment to test the hypothesis that eye and head movements become decoupled\nin visually impaired individuals. Findings indicate that individuals with\nperipheral field loss exhibit significant eye-head decoupling, while those with\nacuity loss demonstrate more synchronized movements. Results for individuals\nwith central field loss were inconclusive but revealed distinct movement\npatterns. These insights provide valuable direction for rehabilitation\nstrategies, assistive-mobility technologies, and urban design improvements. By\nexpanding research on eye-head coordination, this study contributes to the\ndevelopment of interventions that enhance safety, mobility, and independence\nfor individuals with low vision in complex urban environments."}

An\nopen question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access\nto ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided\nstrategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy\ntask that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features can surpass\nspecialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's\npredicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a\nnegative correlation with true prediction error.

Yet the quality of transfused blood varies dramatically among\ndonors-a critical factor often overlooked in clinical practice. Rapid,\nbenchtop, and cost-effective methods for evaluating stored red blood cells\n(RBCs) at the site of transfusion are lacking, with concerns persisting about\nthe association between metabolic signatures of stored RBC quality and\ntransfusion outcomes. Recent studies utilizing metabolomics approaches to\nevaluate stored erythrocytes find that donor biology (e.g., genetics, age,\nlifestyle factors) underlies the heterogeneity associated with blood storage\nand transfusion. The appreciation of donor-intrinsic factors provides\nopportunities for precision transfusion medicine approaches for the evaluation\nof storage quality and prediction of transfusion efficacy. Here we propose a\nnew platform, the Surface Acoustic Wave Hemolysis Assay (SAW-HA), for on-site\nevaluation of stored RBCs utilizing SAW Hemolysis Temperature (SAWHT) as a\nmarker for RBC quality. We report SAWHT as a mechanism-dependent reproducible\nmethodology for evaluating stored human RBCs up to 42 days. Our results define\nunique signatures for SAW hemolysis and metabolic profiles in RBCs from two of\nthe six donors in which high body mass index (BMI) and RBC triglycerides\nassociated with increased susceptibility to hemolysis. Metabolic age of the\nstored RBCs - a recently appreciated predictor of post-transfusion\nefficacy-reveal that RBCs from the two low SAWHT units were characterized by\ndisrupted redox control, deficient tryptophan metabolism, and high BMI.\nTogether, these findings indicate the potential of the SAW-HA as a\npoint-of-care analysis for transfusion medicine."}

Leveraging statistical inference, we infer the\ndynamics of memory B cell clonal dynamics and conversion to plasmablasts, which\nincludes clone creation, degradation, abundance fluctuations, and\ndifferentiation. We find that memory B cell clones degrade slowly, with a\nhalf-life of 10 years.
