However, both\nstages, resolution selection and functional annotation, are inherently\nsubjective, relying on heuristics and expert curation. We present\nHYPOGENEAGENT, a large language model (LLM)-driven framework, transforming\ncluster annotation into a quantitatively optimizable task. Initially, an LLM\nfunctioning as a gene-set analyst analyzes the content of each gene program or\nperturbation module and generates a ranked list of GO-based hypotheses,\naccompanied by calibrated confidence scores. Subsequently, we embed every\npredicted description with a sentence-embedding model, compute pair-wise cosine\nsimilarities, and let the agent referee panel score (i) the internal\nconsistency of the predictions, high average similarity within the same\ncluster, termed intra-cluster agreement (ii) their external distinctiveness,\nlow similarity between clusters, termed inter-cluster separation. These two\nquantities are combined to produce an agent-derived resolution score, which is\nmaximized when clusters exhibit simultaneous coherence and mutual exclusivity.\nWhen applied to a public K562 CRISPRi Perturb-seq dataset as a preliminary\ntest, our Resolution Score selects clustering granularities that exhibit\nalignment with known pathway compared to classical metrics such silhouette\nscore, modularity score for gene functional enrichment summary. These findings\nestablish LLM agents as objective adjudicators of cluster resolution and\nfunctional annotation, thereby paving the way for fully automated,\ncontext-aware interpretation pipelines in single-cell multi-omics studies."}

Methods: Drafting times for IND nonclinical written\nsummaries (eCTD modules 2.6.2, 2.6.4, 2.6.6) generated by AutoIND were directly\nrecorded. For comparison, manual drafting times for IND summaries previously\ncleared by the U.S. FDA were estimated from the experience of regulatory\nwriters ($\\geq$6 years) and used as industry-standard benchmarks. Quality was\nassessed by a blinded regulatory writing assessor using seven pre-specified\ncategories: correctness, completeness, conciseness, consistency, clarity,\nredundancy, and emphasis. Each sub-criterion was scored 0-3 and normalized to a\npercentage. A critical regulatory error was defined as any misrepresentation or\nomission likely to alter regulatory interpretation (e.g., incorrect NOAEL,\nomission of mandatory GLP dose-formulation analysis). Results: AutoIND reduced\ninitial drafting time by $\\sim$97% (from $\\sim$100 h to 3.7 h for 18,870\npages/61 reports in IND-1; and to 2.6 h for 11,425 pages/58 reports in IND-2).\nQuality scores were 69.6\\% and 77.9\\% for IND-1 and IND-2. No critical\nregulatory errors were detected, but deficiencies in emphasis, conciseness, and\nclarity were noted. Conclusions: AutoIND can dramatically accelerate IND\ndrafting, but expert regulatory writers remain essential to mature outputs to\nsubmission-ready quality. Systematic deficiencies identified provide a roadmap\nfor targeted model improvements."}

This updated version, accepted by Physical\n  Review E, presents a more comprehensive set of analytical results", "summary": "We introduce the $\\alpha$-Gauss-Logistic map, a new nonlinear dynamics\nconstructed by composing the logistic and $\\alpha$-Gauss maps. Explicitly, our\nmodel is given by $x_{t+1} = f_L(x_t)x_t^{-\\alpha} - \\lfloor\nf_L(x_t)x_t^{-\\alpha} \\rfloor $ where $f_L(x_t) = r x_t (1-x_t)$ is the\nlogistic map and $ \\lfloor \\ldots \\rfloor $ is the integer part function. Our\ninvestigation reveals a rich phenomenology depending solely on two parameters,\n$r$ and $\\alpha$. For $\\alpha < 1$, the system exhibits multiple\nperiod-doubling cascades to chaos as the parameter $r$ is increased,\ninterspersed with stability windows within the chaotic attractor. In contrast,\nfor $1 \\leq \\alpha < 2$, the onset of chaos is abrupt, occurring without any\nprior bifurcations, and the resulting chaotic attractors emerge without\nstability windows. For $\\alpha \\geq 2$, the regular behavior is absent. The\nspecial case of $\\alpha = 1$ allows an analytical treatment, yielding a\nclosed-form formula for the Lyapunov exponent and conditions for an exact\nuniform invariant density, using the Perron-Frobenius equation. Chaotic regimes\nfor $\\alpha = 1$ can exhibit gaps or be gapless. Surprisingly, the golden ratio\n$\\Phi$ marks the threshold for the disappearance of the largest gap in the\nregime diagram. Additionally, at the edge of chaos in the abrupt transition\nregime, the invariant density approaches a $q$-Gaussian with $q=2$, which\ncorresponds to a Cauchy distribution."}

Active\nlearning -- a machine learning paradigm that selects the most informative data\nto label and train a predictive model -- offers a promising solution, but\ntypically focuses on uncertainty in the individual predictions without\nconsidering uncertainty across the entire dataset. We introduce a new active\nlearning policy, Vendi information gain (VIG), that selects images based on\ntheir impact on dataset-wide prediction uncertainty, capturing both\ninformativeness and diversity. Applied to the Snapshot Serengeti dataset, VIG\nachieves impressive predictive accuracy close to full supervision using less\nthan 10% of the labels. It consistently outperforms standard baselines across\nmetrics and batch sizes, collecting more diverse data in the feature space. VIG\nhas broad applicability beyond ecology, and our results highlight its value for\nbiodiversity monitoring in data-limited environments."}
