In our simulation, prey and predator agents co-evolve their innate\nreward functions, including a possibly fear-like term for observing predators,\nand learn behaviors via reinforcement learning.

There is a hope that the\nsignal of these biotic interactions can be observed and retrieved by\ninvestigating the spatial associations between species while accounting for the\ndirect effects of the environment. By definition, biotic interactions can be\nboth symmetric and asymmetric. Yet, most models that attempt to retrieve\nspecies associations from co-occurrence or co-abundance data internally assume\nsymmetric relationships between species. Here, we propose and validate a\nmachine-learning framework able to retrieve bidirectional associations by\nanalyzing species community and environmental data.\n  Our framework (1) models pairwise species associations as directed influences\nfrom a source to a target species, parameterized with two species-specific\nlatent embeddings: the effect of the source species on the community, and the\nresponse of the target species to the community; and (2) jointly fits these\nassociations within a multi-species conditional generative model with different\nmodes of interactions between environmental drivers and biotic associations.\nUsing both simulated and empirical data, we demonstrate the ability of our\nframework to recover known asymmetric and symmetric associations and highlight\nthe properties of the learned association networks. By comparing our approach\nto other existing models such as joint species distribution models and\nprobabilistic graphical models, we show its superior capacity at retrieving\nsymmetric and asymmetric interactions. The framework is intuitive, modular and\nbroadly applicable across various taxonomic groups."}

Here, we introduce\nthe concept of a meta-autoencoder (MAE): an AE for a collection of\nautoencoders. Given a family of classes that differ from each other by the\nvalues of some parameters, and a trained AE for each class, an MAE for the\nfamily is a neural net that has learned a compact representation and associated\nencoder and decoder for the class-specific AEs. One application of this general\nconcept is in research and modeling of natural evolution -- capturing the\ndefining and the distinguishing properties across multiple species that are\ndynamically evolving from each other and from common ancestors. In this interim\nreport we provide a constructive definition of MAEs, initial examples, and the\nmotivating research directions in machine learning and biology."}

As these\necosystems face mounting pressure from human activities, accurate,\nhigh-resolution habitat maps are essential for effective conservation and\nrestoration. Yet current maps often fall short in thematic or spatial\nresolution because they must (1) model several mutually exclusive habitat types\nthat co-occur across landscapes and (2) cope with severe class imbalance that\ncomplicate multi-class training. Here, we evaluated how high-resolution remote\nsensing (RS) data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools can improve habitat\nclassification over large geographic extents at fine thematic resolution. Using\nvegetation plots from the European Vegetation Archive, we modelled Level 3\nEUNIS habitats across Europe and assessed multiple modelling strategies against\nindependent validation datasets. Strategies that exploited the hierarchical\nnature of habitat nomenclatures resolved classification ambiguities, especially\nin fragmented landscapes. Integrating multi-spectral (MSI) and synthetic\naperture radar (SAR) imagery, particularly through Earth Observation Foundation\nmodels, enhanced within-formation discrimination and overall performance.\nFinally, ensemble machine learning that corrects class imbalance boosted\naccuracy further. Our methodological framework is transferable beyond Europe\nand adaptable to other classification systems. Future research should advance\ntemporal modelling of dynamic habitats, extend to habitat segmentation and\nquality assessment, and exploit next-generation EO data paired with\nhigher-quality in-situ observations."}

The measures\nto be adopted require carefully weighing the social cost against their impact\non disease control. In this work, we analyze, in a context of mobility\nrestrictions, the role of frequent versus occasional contacts in epidemic\nspread. We develop an individual-based mathematical model where frequent\ncontacts among individuals (at home, work, schools) and occasional contacts (at\nstores, transport, etc.) are considered. We define several contact structures\nby changing the relative weight between frequent and occasional contacts while\nkeeping the same initial effective rate of spread. We find the remarkable\nresult that the more frequent contacts prevail over occasional ones, the higher\nthe epidemic peak, the sooner it occurs, and the greater the final number of\nindividuals affected by the epidemic. We conduct our study using an SIR model,\nconsidering both exponential and deterministic recovery from infection, and\nobtain that this effect is more pronounced under deterministic recovery. We\nfind that the impact of relaxation measures depends on the relative importance\nof frequent and occasional contacts within the considered social structures.\nFinally, we assess in which of the considered scenarios the homogeneous mixing\napproximation provides a reasonable description of the epidemic dynamics."}
