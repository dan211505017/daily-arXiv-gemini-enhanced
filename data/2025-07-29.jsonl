Traditional prognostic methods based on clinicopathological\nvariables alone do not fully capture the biological complexity of the disease.\nThis study aims to develop a risk scoring system based on genes associated with\ntumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIIC-associated genes) to improve prognostic\nassessment in CRC.\n  Methods: RNA-seq gene expression and clinicopathological data from TCGA-CRC\n(647 tumor samples, 51 normal tissues) were analyzed to identify differentially\nexpressed TIIC-associated genes through comparison with the CIBERSORTx\ndatabase. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were performed to screen for\nprognostic markers. A Gaussian mixture model was applied to cluster prognostic\nmodels and select the model with the most robust gene combination. The\nresulting risk scoring system was validated in an external cohort (GSE39582)\nand integrated with clinicopathological variables to develop a prognostic\nnomogram.\n  Results: From 128 TIIC-associated genes, an optimal prognostic model\ncomprising CCL8 and TYR was identified. The risk score was calculated as\n0.152*Exp(CCL8) - 0.516*Exp(TYR). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed significant\nsurvival differences between high-risk and low-risk groups in both TCGA-CRC (p\n< 0.05) and GSE39582 (p < 0.05). Time-dependent ROC analysis showed AUC values\nranging from 0.605 to 0.696 for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival in TCGA-CRC\nand GSE39582. Multivariate Cox analysis identified TNM_T, TNM_N, and risk score\nas independent prognostic factors.\n  Conclusion: Our risk scoring system based on CCL8 and TYR effectively\nstratifies CRC patients into distinct prognostic groups and could guide\ntreatment decisions, particularly when integrated with TNM staging in a\nnomogram."}

However,\nquantitative analysis of macrophage behavior in in vivo settings remains\nlimited, largely due to the complexity of their diverse morphologies and\nmotility patterns over time. In this study, we present an analytic workflow to\ninvestigate macrophage dynamics in zebrafish. By computing a comprehensive set\nof morpho-kinetic features, we observe that M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2\n(anti-inflammatory) macrophages exhibit distinct behaviors, such as reduced\nshape elongation, more directed movement, and less random-like motion in M1\ncompared to M2 macrophages. Based on these features, we classify macrophages in\nthe transition period into M1-like and M2-like groups. We compare and analyze\ntheir behaviors, which allows us to estimate the timing of the phenotypic\nswitch. In addition, macrophages not expressing Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) are\nlocated significantly farther from the wound compared to M1 macrophages. While\nmacrophages unstimulated by wound signaling exhibit some M2-like features, they\ndiffer notably in shape elongation and migration speed. In summary, this study\nprovides a quantitative analysis of macrophage behavior during wound healing\nand suggests distinct behavioral landscapes across different macrophage\nactivation states."}

Multiple estimates come from the multiple bins of the\nspectrum with spectroscopy, multiple times with dynamic imaging, or multiple\nfrequencies when utilizing spectral excitation. The method presented in this\nmanuscript, called the L2 optimal method, is compared to the commonly used\nRefPeak method which uses the spectral bin with the highest energy to estimate\nthe sensitivity maps. The L2 optimal method yields more accurate sensitivity\nmaps when imaging a numerical phantom and is shown to yield a higher\nsignal-to-noise ratio when imaging the brain, pancreas, and heart with\nhyperpolarized pyruvate as the contrast agent with hyperpolarized MRI. The L2\noptimal method is able to better estimate the sensitivity by extracting more\ninformation from the measurements."}

Previous studies have added mortality of immature\nindividuals to the maturation delay in discrete population models, finding that\nincreasing the delay results in a decreased population level at equilibrium.\nFurthermore, increasing the maturation delay beyond a critical threshold\nultimately leads to the extinction of the modeled species. Because maturation\ndelays beyond one breeding cycle are often found in nature, clearly, maturation\ndelays must also have a positive benefit leading to a trade-off. We explore\nsuch a trade-off by deriving a class of discrete single species models with a\nmaturation delay and the realistic assumption of a reproductive trade-off. In\nthis reproductive trade-off, although a prolonged maturation delay decreases\nthe total probability of survival, the delay results in larger body sizes which\nwe assume, based on some fish species, to result in higher fecundity. We\nexamine two scenarios: density independent survival and cohort density\ndependent survival of immature individuals. For the mature and immature\nindividuals, we consider two different, but popular, survival functions: the\nBeverton-Holt model and the Ricker model. Overall, we identify a positive\nmaturation delay that maximizes the population size, which we refer to as\n\"optimal maturation delay\"."}

Recently phylogenetic studies have started to\nfocus on a special class of such networks called semi-directed networks. These\ngraphs are defined as mixed graphs that can be obtained by de-orienting some of\nthe arcs in some rooted phylogenetic network, that is, a directed acyclic graph\nwhose leaves correspond to a collection of species and that has a single source\nor root vertex. However, this definition of semi-directed networks is implicit\nin nature since it is not clear when a mixed-graph enjoys this property or not.\nIn this paper, we introduce novel, explicit mathematical characterizations of\nsemi-directed networks, and also multi-semi-directed networks, that is mixed\ngraphs that can be obtained from directed phylogenetic networks that may have\nmore than one root. In addition, through extending foundational tools from the\ntheory of rooted networks into the semi-directed setting - such as cherry\npicking sequences, omnians, and path partitions - we characterize when a\n(multi-)semi-directed network can be obtained by de-orienting some rooted\nnetwork that is contained in one of the well-known classes of tree-child,\norchard, tree-based or forest-based networks. These results address structural\naspects of (multi-)semi-directed networks and pave the way to improved\ntheoretical and computational analyses of such networks, for example, within\nthe development of algebraic evolutionary models that are based on such\nnetworks."}
