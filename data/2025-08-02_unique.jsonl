Recent advances in\nfunctionalized lipid probes -- equipped with photoactivatable crosslinkers,\naffinity handles, and photocleavable protecting groups -- have enabled\nproteomics-based identification of lipid interacting proteins with\nunprecedented specificity and resolution. Despite the growing number of\npublished lipid interactomes, there remains no centralized effort to harmonize,\ncompare, or integrate these datasets.\n  The Lipid Interactome addresses this gap by providing a structured,\ninteractive web portal that adheres to FAIR data principles -- ensuring that\nlipid interactome studies are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and\nReusable. Through standardized data formatting, interactive visualizations, and\ndirect cross-study comparisons, this resource enables researchers to\nsystematically explore the protein-binding partners of diverse bioactive\nlipids. By consolidating and curating lipid interactome proteomics data from\nmultiple studies, the Lipid Interactome database serves as a critical tool for\ndeciphering the biological functions of lipids in cellular systems."}

We previously assessed the\nability of LLMs to perform computational phenotyping tasks using computable\nphenotypes for ARF respiratory support therapies. They successfully performed\nconcept classification and classification of single-therapy phenotypes, but\nunderperformed on multiple-therapy phenotypes. To understand issues with these\ncomplex tasks, we expanded PHEONA, a generalizable framework for evaluation of\nLLMs, to include methods specifically for evaluating faulty reasoning.\nMaterials and Methods: We assessed the responses of three lightweight LLMs\n(DeepSeek-r1 32 billion, Mistral Small 24 billion, and Phi-4 14 billion) both\nwith and without prompt modifications to identify explanation correctness and\nunfaithfulness errors for phenotyping. Results: For experiments without prompt\nmodifications, both errors were present across all models although more\nresponses had explanation correctness errors than unfaithfulness errors. For\nexperiments assessing accuracy impact after prompt modifications, DeepSeek, a\nreasoning model, had the smallest overall accuracy impact when compared to\nMistral and Phi. Discussion: Since reasoning errors were ubiquitous across\nmodels, our enhancement of PHEONA to include a component for assessing faulty\nreasoning provides critical support for LLM evaluation and evidence for\nreasoning errors for complex tasks. While insights from reasoning errors can\nhelp prompt refinement, a deeper understanding of why LLM reasoning errors\noccur will likely require further development and refinement of\ninterpretability methods. Conclusion: Reasoning errors were pervasive across\nLLM responses for computational phenotyping, a complex reasoning task"}

With flexible\nfew-shot reasoning, multimodal integration, and natural-language-based\ninterpretability, large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented\nopportunities for prediction with structured biomedical data. We propose a\nnovel framework called TAP-GPT, Tabular Alzheimer's Prediction GPT, that adapts\nTableGPT2, a multimodal tabular-specialized LLM originally developed for\nbusiness intelligence tasks, for AD diagnosis using structured biomarker data\nwith small sample sizes. Our approach constructs few-shot tabular prompts using\nin-context learning examples from structured biomedical data and finetunes\nTableGPT2 using the parameter-efficient qLoRA adaption for a clinical binary\nclassification task of AD or cognitively normal (CN). The TAP-GPT framework\nharnesses the powerful tabular understanding ability of TableGPT2 and the\nencoded prior knowledge of LLMs to outperform more advanced general-purpose\nLLMs and a tabular foundation model (TFM) developed for prediction tasks.

Vila"], "title": "Factors controlling protein evolvability, at the molecular scale", "categories": ["q-bio.PE", "q-bio.BM"], "comment": null, "summary": "This piece serves two purposes. Firstly, it aims at elucidating the role of\nepistasis in shaping, at a molecular level, the evolutionary paths of proteins,\nas well as the extent to which these epistatic effects are the outcome of an\nas-yet-unidentified epistatic force. Second, it seeks to ascertain the extent\nto which the principle of least action will enable us to identify which of all\npotential trajectories has the highest evolutionary efficiency, as well as how\nvariations in factors such as protein robustness and folding rates, resulting\nfrom the unavoidability of destabilizing mutations, might influence this\ncritical evolutionary process. The initial findings suggest that protein\nevolution, at a molecular level, may be more predictable than previously\nthought, as epistasis and the principle of least action collectively impose\nconstraints on evolutionary paths and trajectories, and consequently, on\nprotein evolvability. Thus, this work should advance our understanding of the\nmain molecular mechanisms that underlie the evolution of mutation-driven\nproteins and also provide grounds to answer a fundamental evolutionary\nquestion: how does Darwinian selection regard all potential trajectories\navailable?"}

The global cases, age-standardized mortality rate , and\nage-standardized disability-adjusted life years attributable to high body mass\nindex were estimated based on age, sex, geographic location, and the\nSocial-demographic Index (SDI).

Ae\naegypti mosquitoes favour urban environments as breeding habitats, so are often\nfound in and around houses. Therefore, it is likely that they will infect\nmembers of the households that they reside around. Since population groupings\nwithin households are small, stochastic effects become important. Despite this,\nlittle work has been carried out to investigate the outcome of releasing\nWolbachia-infected mosquitoes at a household scale, either from an empirical\nand theoretical stand point. In previous work, we developed and analysed a\nstochastic (continuous time Markov chain) model for the invasion of\nWolbachia-infected mosquitoes into a single household containing a population\nof wildtype mosquitoes. In the present study, we extend our framework to a\nconnected community of households coupled by the movement of mosquitoes. We use\nnumerical results obtained via Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm to\ninvestigate optimal strategies for the release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes\ncarried out at either the community or the household scale. We find that\nhousehold scale releases can facilitate rapid and successful invasion of the\nWolbachia-infected mosquitoes into the household population and then into the\nwider community. We further explore the impact of regular household scale\nreleases of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes for a range of compositions for the\nrelease population, time intervals between releases and proportion of\nhouseholds participating in the releases. We find that a single release\nhousehold can provide sufficient protection to the entire community of\nhouseholds if releases are carried out frequently for a number of years and a\nsufficient number of females are released on each occasion."}

We investigate the impact of\nenvironment heterogeneity on mutant fixation in spatially structured\npopulations with demes on the nodes of a graph. When migrations between demes\nare frequent, we demonstrate that environment heterogeneity can amplify natural\nselection and simultaneously accelerate mutant fixation and extinction, thereby\nfostering the quick fixation of beneficial mutants. We evidence this effect in\nthe star graph, more strongly in the line graph, and also in a more general\nclass of graphs. We show that for amplification to occur, mutants must have a\nstronger fitness advantage in demes with stronger migration outflow. In\ncirculation graphs, where migration inflow and outflow are equal in each deme,\nwe find that environment heterogeneity has no impact in a first approximation,\nbut increases the fixation probability of beneficial mutants to second order.\nWhen migrations between demes are rare, we show that environment heterogeneity\ncan also foster amplification of selection, by allowing demes with sufficient\nmutant advantage to become refugia for mutants."}
