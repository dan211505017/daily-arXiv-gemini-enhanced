A common approach to understanding these systems is to\nmodel the dynamics of each subsystem and characterize communication between\nthem. An alternative approach is through the lens of control theory: how the\nsubsystems control one another. This approach involves inferring the\ndirectionality, strength, and contextual modulation of control between\nsubsystems. However, methods for understanding subsystem control are typically\nlinear and cannot adequately describe the rich contextual effects enabled by\nnonlinear complex systems. To bridge this gap, we devise a data-driven\nnonlinear control-theoretic framework to characterize subsystem interactions\nvia the Jacobian of the dynamics. We address the challenge of learning\nJacobians from time-series data by proposing the JacobianODE, a deep learning\nmethod that leverages properties of the Jacobian to directly estimate it for\narbitrary dynamical systems from data alone. We show that JacobianODEs\noutperform existing Jacobian estimation methods on challenging systems,\nincluding high-dimensional chaos. Applying our approach to a multi-area\nrecurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a working memory selection task, we\nshow that the \"sensory\" area gains greater control over the \"cognitive\" area\nover learning. Furthermore, we leverage the JacobianODE to directly control the\ntrained RNN, enabling precise manipulation of its behavior. Our work lays the\nfoundation for a theoretically grounded and data-driven understanding of\ninteractions among biological subsystems."}

However, the high cost of multi-omics profiling imposes a\nsignificant economic burden, with over reliance on full omics data potentially\nleading to unnecessary resource consumption. To address these issues, we\npropose an uncertainty-aware, multi-view dynamic decision framework for omics\ndata classification that aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy while\nminimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the\nactivation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution\nparameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and\nuncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of\na specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter\ncaptures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a\nmore trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ\na fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous\nmodalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and\nrobustness. A dynamic decision mechanism is then applied that omics data are\nincrementally introduced for each patient until either all data sources are\nutilized or the model confidence exceeds a predefined threshold, potentially\nbefore all data sources are utilized. Results and Conclusion: We evaluate our\napproach on four benchmark multi-omics datasets, ROSMAP, LGG, BRCA, and KIPAN.\nIn three datasets, over 50% of cases achieved accurate classification using a\nsingle omics modality, effectively reducing redundant testing. Meanwhile, our\nmethod maintains diagnostic performance comparable to full-omics models and\npreserves essential biological insights."}

Recent advances in synthetic biology have demonstrated that the code\nis remarkably flexible--organisms can survive with 61 codons instead of 64,\nnatural variants have reassigned codons 38+ times, and fitness costs of\nrecoding stem primarily from secondary mutations rather than code changes\nthemselves. Yet despite billions of years of evolution and this proven\nflexibility, approximately 99% of life maintains an identical 64-codon genetic\ncode. This extreme conservation cannot be fully explained by current\nevolutionary theory, which predicts far more variation given the demonstrated\nviability of alternatives. I propose that this paradox--evolutionary\nflexibility coupled with mysterious conservation--reveals unrecognized\nconstraints on biological information systems. This paper presents testable\npredictions to distinguish between competing explanations: extreme network\neffects, hidden optimization parameters, or potentially, computational\narchitecture constraints that transcend standard evolutionary pressures."}

In the presence\nof multiplicative noise, generated by environmental perturbations, the model\nexhibits noise-induced transitions. The bifurcation diagram has two distinct\nregions of unimodality and bimodality in which the steady-state probability\ndistribution has one and two peaks, respectively. Apart from first-order\ntransitions between the two regimes, a critical-point transition occurs at a\ncusp point with the transition belonging to the mean-field Ising universality\nclass. The epidemic model shares these features with the well-known\nHorsthemke-Lefever model of population genetics. The effect of vaccination on\nthe spread/containment of the epidemic in a stochastic setting is also studied.\nWe further propose a general vaccine-hesitancy model, along the lines of\nKirman's ant model, with the steady-state distribution of the fraction of the\nvaccine-willing population given by the Beta distribution. The distribution is\nshown to give a good fit to the COVID-19 data on vaccine hesitancy and\nvaccination.
